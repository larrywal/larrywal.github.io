This was a very unique year for us.&nbsp; Festival 45 had just four attendees - 
Bob &amp; Pam, BJ Wood and Amanda Grant.&nbsp; This was the year of the coronavirus 
(COVID-19).&nbsp; We had two potential dates scheduled but, in the interest of 
safety, had to give up on both.&nbsp; So BJ and Amanda visited, with masks and 
social distancing, and we went with an abbreviated four minute fireworks show.&nbsp; 
Because of the pandemic-related turmoil, Lee Greenwood and Home Free and the USAF 
Band Singing Sergeants remade "God Bless the USA" from their varied remote 
locations.&nbsp; We felt this was the perfect match for our 2020 Fireworks 
Extravaganza.&nbsp; So the Festivals continue, and we look forward to a 
full-blown Festival in 2021.</p>
