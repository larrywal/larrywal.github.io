		<p>Hi.&nbsp; I&#39;m Blaze, and the left picture above is of me as a little puppy.&nbsp; 
		I grew a lot bigger and you can see the modern mature me in the second 
		picture.&nbsp; I was a real pain for a while, and refused to stop 
		barking at the UPS man.&nbsp; &nbsp; But I was a great retreiver, and 
		could chase and retrieve a ball over and over until I could not move 
		anymore.&nbsp; At first I hated when 
		people paid more attention to my brother <a href="taz.htm">Taz</a> 
		just because he was little and cute, but I got over it, and I kind of 
		liked him myself.&nbsp; But I always stuck my nose in 
		to make sure they petted me just as much as they petted him!</p>
		<p>One of the highlights of my first year was a visit to Stamford when I 
		got to go swimming - wow was that fun.&nbsp; I&#39;m not sure everybody else 
		thought so, but I sure did!&nbsp; Check out the photos.&nbsp; They 
		wouldn&#39;t let me into their kayak.&nbsp; Later they wouldn't even let me in 
		the water because I would get all muddy and then run into the house.&nbsp; 
		Maybe they forgot that I was a dog - what did they expect?</p>

		<p>Check out the winter shot of me below from early 2010.&nbsp; Didn&#39;t I 
		look like one of my ancestor wolves?&nbsp; I bet the Big Bad Wolf is back there 
		in my ancestry somewhere.&nbsp; Maybe that explains why I was the way I 
		was.&nbsp; But at 
		least <strong>I</strong> knew I was a good boy.&nbsp; That&#39;s what really 
		mattered!</p>

		<p>
		Anyway, in early 2015 I got pretty sick, and my family did a great job 
		of taking care of me.&nbsp; They gave me pills to control the pain, and 
		I kept waggling my tail right up until it was time to go to doggie 
		heaven.&nbsp; I'm now here with my cousin Charlie who has been here for 
		five years, and he is showing me around.&nbsp; We plan to have a great 
		time now that we are together again!</p>
