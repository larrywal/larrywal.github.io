This was another sad year for us, with the COVID-19 pandemic still quite active, 
and the need to supress large crowds.&nbsp; We put safety first, and decided to 
gear up for a spectacular 2022 (hopefully)!&nbsp; But we couldn't just skip a 
year, so for the second year in a row, we created a smaller fireworks show, and 
invited only close-by family members.&nbsp; Samantha, Andrew, Alex &amp; Tori 
Perzel, as well as BJ Wood and Amanda Grant joined us for an 8-person Festival 
(+3 dogs, Marley, Mugsy and Brownie).&nbsp; That was double the size of last 
year's 4-person Festival, so at least we were moving in the right direction.</p>
<p class="style1">
We brought in a new game, Kubb (rhymes with tube), and you can see pictures of 
us competing.&nbsp; There's also a dinner photo, a full "crowd" photo, and some 
fireworks still shots.&nbsp; </p>
