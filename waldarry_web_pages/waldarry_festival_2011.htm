<p class="style1">It was a stretch this year, but the theme was 5,000 hot 
dogs served.&nbsp; We've been at it since 1976!&nbsp;&nbsp; The weather was a 
repeat of last year - a high of 93 degrees keeping us all warm and toasty.&nbsp; 
We still had 131 people making an appearance , and most still there 
for the fantastic fireworks display.&nbsp; If you'd like to see 
the Grand Finale again, or if you just happened not to be there, you can see the 
video (5:16) on YouTube at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560sVJo4iYE">
