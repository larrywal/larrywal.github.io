<p class="style1">This year we celebrated a sesquicentennial (150 years).&nbsp; 
It marked 70 years of Pam Wood, 70 years of Bob Waldman, and 10 years of Pam and 
Bob together.&nbsp; A festive occasion to say the least!</p>

<p class="style1">The day had an ominous beginning, with 0.77 inches of rain 
falling between 9 and 10 AM, causing a delayed setup.&nbsp; But the weather 
junkies said there would be no more rain until at least late evening, so the 
starting gun was sounded and the "go-for-it" was given.&nbsp; It was a wise 
decision as no more rain fell, and with a high temperature of 84 degrees, it was 
all-in-all a pretty decent day.</p>
<p class="style1">We had a good crowd 
with 133 people in attendance.&nbsp; We had folks travelling in from Los 
Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Ottawa, Montreal, Virginia, Maryland, 
Washington DC, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and the usual local commuters from Connecticut, New York and New 
Jersey.</p>
<p class="style1">We had our now standard rocket launchings (with some 
occasional glitches this year), and we had another spectacular fireworks show 
(not without its very own startup glitches). Also presented was the very first 
Waldarry Flash-Mob Musical Production, featuring Sweet Caroline.&nbsp; You can 
see the Flash Mob and the Fireworks videos by clicking the links below.&nbsp; </p>
