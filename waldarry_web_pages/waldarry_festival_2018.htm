<p class="style1">This year we had 108 Festival attendees.&nbsp; The theme was 
the "The 13 Waldarrys," an expansion due to the arrival the 13th Waldarry, 
Kennedy Waldman.&nbsp; It also happened to be Bob and Pam's 13th anniversary 
celebration.</p>
<p class="style1">The forecast was accurate, with temperatures in the high 
80's, but reasonably comfortable.</p>
<p class="style1">We had guests from the states of Washington, California, 
Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, 
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and locals from New York and Connecticut.&nbsp; 
Additionally, we had Canadians from Ottawa and Montreal.</p>
<p class="style1">There were three rocket launchings, all coming off perfectly 
on the first try.&nbsp; We made up for that with the fireworks show, which took 
two false starts before finally getting it right.&nbsp; The delays caused us to 
reach 10 PM, and got us to the point where a thunderstorm was making its way in.&nbsp; 
But we got through it and had about 10 minutes to get all the equipment inside 
before the heavens burst forth.&nbsp; So all was well in Waldarryland. </p>
<p class="style1">This was the year we lost our big oak tree (back on May 15th), 
so we had brighter sunshine during the day, but that led to a completely open sky for 
the fireworks, a marked improvement in viewing capability.&nbsp; The tree stump 
was saved as a monument, and you can see some photos above.&nbsp;</p>

The fireworks (18 minutes) can be seen by clicking

Parts of the beginning are somewhat distorted due to camera issues, but it 
clears up by the 8 minute mark.&nbsp; A special thank you to Curtis Washington who 
rescued us by sending us his video of most of the show.&nbsp; Then for a rather unique view of the entire day in 58 seconds as taken from our porch 
webcam click <a href="https://1drv.ms/v/s!AtdwFWd-Oxl_1PM2LIjN_KUbjM3h0Q">webcam
