<p class="style1">The theme this year was our first use of a Quick Response Code 
on our invitation.&nbsp; Forty-four attendees were geeky enough to use the code 
to learn our secret password and earn themselves an original Waldarry Festival 
drink Koozie.&nbsp; Wow!</p>
<p class="style1">After two straight years of scorching hot Festivals, we had a 
beautiful day with temperatures in the high seventies and low eighties.&nbsp; We 
had 110 comfortable guests in attendance (except for the two who fell into the 
pond!).</p>
<p class="style1">You can see a collection of photos from the day at
<a href="https://1drv.ms/f/s!AtdwFWd-Oxl_kmaAGu0fQ8Duj9K2">Festival Photos 2012</a>.&nbsp; In addition, 
the complete fireworks video (17 minutes) can be seen at

Festival Fireworks 2012</a>.&nbsp; This was our very first 
fully electronics fireworks show - the culmination of two years of development!&nbsp; Thanks to all who came and helped make it a great day!</p>
<p class="style1">Here is a 
photo of the fireworks show taken by Laura Rispoli.&nbsp; This is probably the best 
fireworks photo we have ever had from a Waldarry Festival.&nbsp; Thank you 
Laura!&nbsp; Also thanks to Leslie &amp; Casey Johnson for several of our other 
great photos.</p>
