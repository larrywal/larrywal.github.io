		<p><font size="5" color="#800000" face="Marigold">We left Venice before any tourists were up and drove to Milan through Padua and Verona. In Milan we visited the GG offices and walked around the center. </font></p>
		<p><font size="5" color="#800000" face="Marigold">We left Milan and drove to Torino where we knew we would be visiting with relatives. The first person to welcome us was Grace, Lydia&rsquo;s daughter (Lydia is Joyce&rsquo;s great aunt). We followed Grace to Lydia&rsquo;s house where we were also able to meet Luciano, one of Grace&rsquo;s children. Lydia&rsquo;s home is a lovely one overlooking the city. Billy and Larry said that being in Lydia&rsquo;s house was a little like visiting a museum. We were even able to have a wonderful lunch at Lydia&rsquo;s. They adjusted their menu knowing that Billy, Larry and Bob were fussy eaters.</font></p>
		<p><font size="5" color="#800000" face="Marigold">During the winter we had located Bice (Joyce&rsquo;s fourth cousin) on the Internet. We made arrangements to meet in Turin during their summer holidays. We were treated to a wonderful gelato by Bice, Edoardo, and their new and friendly dog.</font></p>
		<p><font size="5" color="#800000" face="Marigold">Bice had introduced us to Ada and Gianfranco (online). Ada too was Joyce&rsquo;s distant cousin (third cousin, once removed). Unfortunately, the holidays of Bice and Edoardo didn&rsquo;t coincide with Ada and Gianfranco&rsquo;s. That ended up lucky for us, as were were treated to another gelato by Ada and Gianfranco. In addition, Gianfranco was able to give us many important documents relating to Joyce&rsquo;s family.</font></p>
		<p><font size="5" color="#800000" face="Marigold">From Turino we took a trip to Montcalvo, Italy, trying to search for more Family Roots. It was a very successful trip. To hear more about the Montcalvo visit, see <a href="italy_-_family%20roots.htm">Family Roots</a>. </font></p>
		<p><font size="5" color="#800000" face="Marigold">From Turino we also took a day and drove to <b>Courmayeur</b>. Unfortunately, based on the number of cars, it seemed like everyone in northern Italy had the same idea. Our original plan had been to take the cable car crossings from Courmayeur to Chamonix, France. Unfortunately, it was too windy and the cable cars were not working. It was still a beautiful drive and we visited several ancient castles en route. </font></p>
