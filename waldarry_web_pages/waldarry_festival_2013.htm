<p class="style1">&quot;Spirit of 76&quot; was the theme this year.&nbsp; Billy and Larry 
each turned 30, and Alex had her Sweet 16, so 30+30+16=76!&nbsp; We even hung a 
celebratory flag to honor the occasion, and had a special cake decorated by Alex 
and friend Savannah to emphasize the festival theme.</p>

<p class="style1">We had forecasts of occasional severe thunderstorms, but used 
all our charm to keep them at bay.&nbsp; In fact it never rained at all, and was 
a fairly nice day, with a high of 94 degrees.&nbsp; Believe it or not, that was 
actually cooler than the prior couple of years, so all in all the weather was good to us.</p>
<p class="style1">We had 102 guests in attendance, of which most were still 
around for the evening fireworks.&nbsp; We estimate about twenty folks were 
attending their first Waldarry Festival, so we hope we provided them the 
experience of a lifetime!</p>
