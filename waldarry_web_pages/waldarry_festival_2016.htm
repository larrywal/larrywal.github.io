<p class="style1">This year's Festival brought 102 people together on July 16th 
to celebrate the engagement of Larry Waldman and Katie Beltrone!</p>

<p class="style1">The forecast was spectacular - high about 90 degrees, and 
absolutely zero per cent chance of rain.&nbsp; Wow!&nbsp; Of course, at 5:08 PM 
we had the "impossible" cloudburst and 0.06" rain over about ten minutes.&nbsp; 
We took shelter, waited 15 minutes, dried everything off, and were back in full 
swing with little time lost.&nbsp; As to temperature, we hit a high of 95<sup>o</sup> 
just before the rain hit, but it was not a big issue as personal Waldarry 
Coolant Systems were available for all attendees.</p>
<p class="style1">We had guests from Seattle (that's Larry and Katie, of 
course), San Francisco (Larry's brother Billy), Phoenix (Katie's parents - shown 
in picture above), as well as New Orleans, Virginia, Massachusetts, New Jersey, 
and locals from New York and Connecticut.</p>
<p class="style1">There were two rocket launchings, and we had another 
spectacular fireworks show.&nbsp; There were two false starts to the show 
(nothing is ever easy), but then a perfect performance once it hit its stride.</p>
