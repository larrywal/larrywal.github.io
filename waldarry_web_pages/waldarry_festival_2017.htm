<p class="style1">This year we had 105 Festival attendees.&nbsp; The theme was 
the "Power of Twelve," primarily dedicated to the twelve Waldarry family 
members.&nbsp; The number 12 was leveraged for other calculations related to the 
Waldarry family, including Pam &amp; Bob's 12th anniversary.</p>
<p class="style1">The weather was good.&nbsp; A few days of rain prior to the 
Festival filled up the pond to allow excellent kayaking opportunities.&nbsp; The 
rain stopped early Saturday morning, and our day was partially sunny with a high 
of 86 degrees.&nbsp; Perfect!</p>
<p class="style1">We had guests from the states of Washington, California, 
Oregon, Virginia, Massachusetts, New Jersey, 
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and locals from New York and Connecticut.&nbsp; 
Additionally, we had Canadians from Ottawa and Montreal.</p>
<p class="style1">There were three rocket launchings, and we had another 
spectacular fireworks show.&nbsp; As usual, there was a false start to the show 
(nothing is ever easy), but then it was a perfect performance once it hit its stride.</p>
