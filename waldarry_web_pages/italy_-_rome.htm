		<p><font size="5" color="#800000" face="Marigold">We arrived in Rome and after some desperately needed sleep set out for the Coliseum. It was really fascinating to see how the remains are still there, right in the middle of the city. The Romans have done a great job of integrating the old architecture with the new. We walked through a good part of the city visiting Castel Sant&rsquo;Angelo, the Forum, the Pantheon, Fountain of Trevi, Arch of Titus, Piazza di Spagna, Trastevere, and many other places. </font></p>
		<p><font size="5" color="#800000" face="Marigold">We spent a lot of time checking out the family roots (the Fornari side of the family). We even visited with Roberto (Joyce&rsquo;s mother Gaby&rsquo;s first cousin) who lives in the house that Joyce&rsquo;s grandparents moved into during the early 1900s. We passed the building where Joyce&rsquo;s grandmother, Valentina lived. We even searched the cemeteries for long lost family. </font></p>
		<p><font size="5" color="#800000" face="Marigold">We were smart, we waited to rent our car until we were ready to leave Rome. The traffic is crazy. We had enough trouble as pedestrians!</font></p>
