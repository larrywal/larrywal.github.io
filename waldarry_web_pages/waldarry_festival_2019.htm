<p class="style1">This year we had 96 Festival attendees.&nbsp; The weather was 
perfect - 88 degrees and sunny, yet not overbearing.&nbsp; The theme was 
the "500 Years of Waldarrys," - when adding the ages of the 13 Waldarrys on their 
2019 birthdays you get exactly 500!&nbsp; What a spectacular reason to party!</p>
<p class="style1">We had guests from the District of Columbia, the states of Washington, California, 
Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont and locals from New York and Connecticut.&nbsp; 
Additionally, we had Canadians from Ottawa and Montreal.</p>
<p class="style1">We had three rocket launchings, each tracked by a drone flying 
high above them.&nbsp; The exciting fireworks show lasted 16 minutes through a 
medley of patriotic songs.</p>
