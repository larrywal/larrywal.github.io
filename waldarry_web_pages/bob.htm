		<hr>
		<p>I continue my retired life, and find plenty to keep me busy.&nbsp; 
		Just trying to keep this web site up-to-date is almost a full-time job!.&nbsp; 
		I spend a lot of time looking at Pam's great
		<a href="https://1drv.ms/f/s!AtdwFWd-Oxl_yaV_H3TfOjG8-rARNw">gardens</a> out back, as well as photographing the varied
		<a href="https://1drv.ms/f/s!AtdwFWd-Oxl_yaULpn5pN4kuIs8qkQ">wildlife</a> attracted there.&nbsp; We sometimes get to 
		babysit our grand-doggies <a href="taz.htm">Taz</a>,
		<a href="bailey.htm">Bailey</a>, <a href="mugsy.htm">
		Mugsy</a> and <a href="brownie.htm">Brownie</a>.&nbsp; We also keep busy preparing for the annual
		Waldarry Festival.&nbsp; With <a href="pam.htm">Pam</a> also retired, 
		we work at finding things to keep us busy.&nbsp; We spend a lot of time recording 
		both family's <a href="genealogy.htm">genealogies</a>, so that is likely 
		to continue.</p>
		<p><a href="billy.htm">Billy</a> and <a href="larry.htm">Larry</a> 
		continue to do fine but they are far away.&nbsp; 
		<a href="larry.htm">Larry</a> is now married to <a href="Katie.htm">
		Katie</a>, and she fits in perfectly with the rest of the Waldarrys 
		(that's a big compliment)!&nbsp; Last year, on Valentine's Day they 
		added <a href="kennedy.htm">Kenzie</a>, the 13th Fabulous Waldarry!&nbsp; All the 
		other grandchildren - <a href="Alex.htm">Alex</a>, 
		<a href="Tori.htm">Tori</a>, and <a href="a3.htm">Andrew III (A3)</a>.- 
		visit just the right amount to be fun without driving us crazy.&nbsp; 
		Otherwise they're <a href="samantha.htm">Samn</a> and <a href="a2.htm">
		A2's</a> problem - phew!</p>
		<p>We still have a monthly poker game (see <a href="poker%20gang.htm">photo</a> 
		of the regular gang), so I do try to support the family (sometimes even 
		successfully).</p>
		<p>I continue to run a collection of internet-based
		<a href="../pools.htm">sports pools</a> (started in 2006) which helps keep in touch with 
		many old friends.&nbsp; <a href="billy.htm">Billy</a> &amp;
		<a href="larry.htm">Larry</a> also have many of their friends in the 
		pools as well.&nbsp; If you're into sports check them out and come join us.</p>
		<p>Anyway, please drop me an email
		<a href="mailto:bob.waldman@gmail.com?subject=Mail from Bob's waldarry.com webpage">(bob.waldman@gmail.com)</a> and let me know you were here.&nbsp; I'd 
		love to hear from you!</p>
