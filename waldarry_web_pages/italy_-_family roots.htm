		<p><font size="5" color="#800080" face="Marigold">The main reasons for our trip to Italy were to visit relatives, see the sights, and visit cemeteries to collect information on our ancestry. Most family cemeteries were located in Rome and Turin. The possibility of finding one of our family branches in the small town of Moncalvo in the Turin area came about based upon earlier research we had done. It was something like a treasure hunt with no treasure map, but we were determined to discover our roots. We began in Rome, looking for the Fornari connection (Joyce's mom's family). Success!</font></p>

		<p><font size="5" color="#800080" face="Marigold">Turin had a very large cemetery and we easily found some of the more recent stones. But we kept searching, and in an old part of the cemetery we hit a gold mine, finding Joyce's great-grandfather (Lazzaro Fubini), and then her great-great-grandfather (Giuseppe Foa), and others from that era.</font></p>

		<p><font size="5" color="#800080" face="Marigold">But the highlight of our &quot;search for our roots&quot; had to be on August 10th, 1996, when we set out to find the small town of Moncalvo, about a two hour drive into rural countryside outside of Turin. We had some unconfirmed documents that showed Joyce's father's mother's family came from Moncalvo, and we had the names Marco Luzzati and Annetta Luzzati in Joyce's tree. After much searching we found the old abandoned graveyard, which had a wall around it and was locked tightly shut. Billy and Larry looked over the top 
		(from Bob's shoulders) and could see the overgrown graves, but could not get in. But we did not come that far to give up, so Bob wound up (gulp) climbing the wall (would he ever manage to get out?), and then we heard the yell &quot;it's here!&quot; There was the mausoleum for Marco Luzzati and his family, all the way back to Joyce's great-great-great grandmother Giustina Luzzati (1816-1892). A successful trip, beyond our wildest imagination! And yes, by the way, Bob did manage to get back out. A few scrapes and bruises, but well worth the effort!</font></p>
