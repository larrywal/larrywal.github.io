<p class="style1">Pam finally joined Bob in retirement, and that was the theme 
for this year's Festival.&nbsp; It was a brutally hot day with full sun and well 
into the 90's, but 187 people still braved it out, and over 100 were still there 
for the fantastic (&quot;best ever&quot;) fireworks display.&nbsp; If you'd like to see 
the Grand Finale again, or if you just happened not to be there, you can see the 
video (4:34) on YouTube at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnP0tlzhThk">
Festival Fireworks 2010</a>.</p>

<p class="style1">Thanks to all who came and helped make it a great day!</p>
