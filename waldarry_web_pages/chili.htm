		<p class="MsoNormal">Well, 2019 was not such a good year for me.&nbsp; 
		On April 11th I became suddenly ill and was rushed to an all night 
		veterinary hospital.&nbsp; I was diagnosed with both a failing pancreas 
		and liver, and sadly I did not even make it through the night.&nbsp; I 
		had just had a full checkup two months earlier, so this was quite a 
		shock to myself and my family.&nbsp; But life can have its sudden turns 
		and at least now I am in doggie heaven with my predesessor Charlie.&nbsp; 
		So don't feel too badly for me, although you are allowed to miss me.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">Here's a little history about myself.&nbsp; My name is Chilcoot, but I 
		was usually 
		simply called Chili.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was named after the Chilcoot Trail on 
		Mount Madonna at Smuggler's Notch, a favorite run of my family.&nbsp; I 
		was born August 8, 2010 at Cirius Kennels in Stormville, New York, the 
		ninth of ten puppies born to Candy and Boomer.&nbsp; I used to be a fun loving little boy puppy.&nbsp; 
		Then I became a middle-aged pain in the butt.&nbsp; I liked to whine a lot, 
		always wanted to eat, and was always on the wrong side of any door.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		But of course I was still lovable.&nbsp; I enjoyed running around in the 
		backyard, lying down and watching TV with my family, and licking peanut 
		butter stuffed into a big bone.&nbsp; I always looked forward to the 
		annual Waldarry Festival when I could scamper around the backyard looking 
		for any food that dropped to the ground - or dare I say was exposed on a 
		low table?&nbsp; Yup, while I was lovable, I was a little bit of a bad 
		doggie.&nbsp; </p>
