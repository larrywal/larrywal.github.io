<p class="style1">This year we celebrated Pam's son BJ's 40th birthday, and we 
snuck in another cake for Daniel Sauter's sixth birthday which fell exactly on 
party day - July 19th.&nbsp;&nbsp;BJ's three layer cake was created by Alex 
Perzel, and hostess Pam designed the cake for Daniel, working with Pat Sauter 
and Tori Perzel.</p>

<p class="style1">After two years in a row of brutal 90 degree heat, we had a 
beautiful day with a high temperature of 76<sup>o</sup>.&nbsp; It was actually a 
bit chilly by fireworks time.</p>
<p class="style1">The good weather brought out our biggest crowd since 2010, 
with 139 people in attendance.&nbsp; We had folks travelling in from Los 
Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Vancouver, Ottawa, Montreal, New Orleans, 
Pittsburgh, Virginia, Boston, and of course the locals from Connecticut, New York and New 
Jersey.</p>
