<p class="auto-style1">History of the Waldarry Festivals</p>
<img class="auto-style4" height="60" src="../images/general/Evolution%20of%20Racoon.jpg" style="float: right" width="111" /><p class="MsoNormal">The history of Waldman family summer parties began back in 
1976.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Brookdale Drive home was 
purchased in March of that year, and the first party was to celebrate the 200<sup>th</sup> 
anniversary of the United States.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It 
was scheduled for July 4<sup>th</sup>, but had to be delayed when Bob Waldman 
was bitten by a raccoon and was undergoing a series of anti-rabies shots.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The party was held several weeks later, kicking off the annual summer 
tradition.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<img class="auto-style4" height="77" src="../images/general/Evolution%20of%20Communication.jpg" style="float: left" width="79" />The first three years the parties were informal, with 
invites by word of mouth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The first 
formal invitation was in 1979, for a “Brooklyn in Connecticut” party.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>While there were also formal invitations for 1980 and 1981, none have been 
located for 1982 to 1984.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then there 
were two invitational parties in 1985, one in 1986, and two again in 1987.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>From 1988 forward there was one big summer party each year.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>So the only years for which invitations either did not exist or have not 
been located are 1976 to 1978 and 1982 to 1984.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<img class="auto-style4" height="37" src="../images/general/Evolution%20of%20Waldini%20Festival.jpg" style="float: right" width="117" />The first year that the term Festival was used was 1995, 
the first year of the folded brochure invitation, celebrating Fifty Years of Bob 
Waldman for “The Annual Waldini Festival".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>These continued unabated until 2004.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<img class="auto-style4" height="45" src="../images/general/Evolution%20of%20Waldarry%20Festival.jpg" style="float: left" width="135" />The year 2005 marked the transition from the Waldini 
Festival to the Waldarry Festival, celebrating the “Island Wedding” of Bob 
Waldman and Pam Wood.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These have 
continued again unabated through the present time.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<img class="auto-style4" height="64" src="../images/general/Evolution%20of%20People.jpg" style="float: right" width="59" />While the earliest parties involved on average about 30 
attendees, the number gradually grew, and by the mid-1990s had reached well into 
the 200s.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The peak count was in 2002 
with exactly 300 people attending the Festival.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The 2005 Wedding attracted 223 attendees, and then the number began to 
gradually decrease as Bob and Pam left the workforce so fewer co-workers were invited.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the most recent few years the average has been about 110 people.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<img class="auto-style4" height="43" src="../images/general/Evolution%20of%20Rain.jpg" style="float: left" width="50" />Throughout this entire timeframe there has been only one 
postponement from Saturday until Sunday due to weather.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>That was in 2000.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There were 
years that we did get rained on a bit, but never in a big enough way to damage 
the overall party spirit.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<img border="1" height="58" hspace="15" src="../images/general/Evolution%20of%20Music.jpg" style="float: right" width="255" />It is also interesting to note a couple of key areas of 
Festival development.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the music 
category, music was initially provided by reel-to-reel tapes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In 1980 the move was made to cassette tapes, and in 1994 custom made CD 
music took center stage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was in 
2000 that the move was made to a PC music server, followed by streaming the 
festival playlist from the internet starting in 2017.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<img class="auto-style3" height="94" src="../images/general/Evolution%20of%20Fireworks.jpg" style="float: left" width="101" />Another major category of evolution was the fireworks show.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Sparklers were made available in 1979, and this evolved slowly into 
bigger and bigger fountain fireworks, all announced and lit one at a time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The first attempt at a show set to music was in 1993 – a simple show with 
some badly timed firework displays, but a start.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This evolved year after year into ever more sophistication, with a squad 
of black dressed volunteers scurrying around manually placing and lighting the 
fireworks attempting to time the action to the music.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was in 2012 that we introduced our first ever fully electronic 
wirelessly controlled fireworks show, fully and carefully timed to the music.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Lights were incorporated into the show a year later, and incremental 
sophistication has been introduced each year since.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<img class="auto-style4" height="53" src="../images/general/Evolution%20of%20Rockets.jpg" style="float: left" width="97" />A few other highlights added through the years were rocket 
launchings in 1998, additional sound speakers added in the pond area in 2004, 
kayaking in 2006 as well as an array of evening solar lights the same year, and 
a new barbeque platform was added in 2012.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<img height="108" src="../images/general/Evolution%20of%20Covid.jpg" style="float: right" width="104" />Sadly, in 2020, we were all hit with the coronavirus pandemic, and we had to 
cancel the major festivities that were planned.&nbsp; But we were not going to 
give up completely, so we prepared an abbreviated fireworks show, invited BJ 
Wood and Amanda Grant to join us for the limited, but still spectacular, 
Waldarry Festival 2020.&nbsp; That kept the streak going at 45 consecutive 
Waldarry Festivals!&nbsp; Then came 2021, with COVID19 still a big issue.&nbsp; 
We had a total 8 person Festival, and ran it much as we did in 2020.&nbsp; So we 
struggled but kept it going for 46 straight Festivals.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So, all in all, we have seen an evolution from an informal 
beginning of annual parties into a much evolved annual Festival.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hopefully they will continue well into the future.</p>
