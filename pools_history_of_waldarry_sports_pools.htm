History of Waldarry Sports Pools:</strong></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="auto-style1">The official Waldarry Sports 
Pools were inaugurated in late 2006 with a Major League Baseball Playoff pool.</span><span class="auto-style1" style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="auto-style1">A website, </span>
<a href="http://www.waldarry.com/pools.htm"><span class="auto-style1">
www.waldarry.com/pools.htm</span></a><span class="auto-style1" style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="auto-style1">was established, and all trophy results and 
pool summaries were recorded to the website.</span><span class="auto-style1" style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="auto-style1">Trophy winners were installed as members of the 
Waldarry Hall of Champions.</span><span class="auto-style1" style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="auto-style1">In 2009 the All-Time Leaderboard was added to 
the website, which tracked cumulative results for all the players since 
inception.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="auto-style1">The genesis of these pools goes 
all the way back to at least 1997, and probably even a few years earlier.</span><span class="auto-style1" style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="auto-style1">Pools were run sporadically, and none were run 
from 1999 to 2003.</span><span class="auto-style1" style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="auto-style1">They began again in 2004, but it was in 2006 
that they began to be run on a regular basis, with eight pools covering 
football, baseball and basketball.</span><span class="auto-style1" style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="auto-style1">Due to popular request, a college football bowl 
pool and an NHL Stanley Cup Hockey pool were added in 2008 and 2009 
respectively.</span><span class="auto-style1" style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="auto-style1">Two more additions came along in 2014 – the 
National Hockey League regular season pool, and for a unique new addition, the 
first International Olympics pool.</span><o:p>&nbsp; <span class="auto-style1">
Pro Golf was added in 2016, and World Cup Soccer in 2018.</span></o:p></p>

players making it into the Waldarry Hall of Champions at the end of 2009, and 
that number grew to 123 by 2020.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Of
