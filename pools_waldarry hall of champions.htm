at the Gold, but if he lost that he would fall to a Bronze.&nbsp; He went for 
the glory, but alas the Rangers could not pull it off.&nbsp; So Bob Waldman hung 
on for the Gold, Len Bergstrom moved up to the Silver, and Brandon took the 
Bronze.&nbsp; George Rosevally also tied Len and Brandon, but lost on

<span style="font-weight: 400">This Olympics was marred by covid issues and more 
Russian doping issues.&nbsp; But it actually went fairly smoothly, with Norway, 
Germany and Russia finishing in the top three.&nbsp; For us, this was an amazing 
run.&nbsp; Joe Milano took hold of first place immediately, and other then one 
brief day when he fell behind, he led the crowd all the way.</span></span></font></span><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp; 
A spectacular performance from one of our veterans.&nbsp; Four of us had 
identical picks - George Rosevally, Michael Arvold, Mike Defede and Ryan 
Milligan.&nbsp; This group managed to finish second, so we had to go to the 
winning country's score as the tiebreaker.&nbsp; All estimates were high, so 
Michael Arvold took second with&nbsp; the lowest estimate, and Mike Defede third 
with the next lowest.&nbsp; This was Joe's record-setting second Gold Medal in 
this pool (2018).&nbsp; It allowed Joe to move up from 10th to 9th on the 
all-time leaderboard, passing Larry J. Waldman.&nbsp; This was Michael Arvold's 
first award in this pool.&nbsp; For Mike Defede, this was his second consecutive 
medal in this pool, tying Pam Wood, Ryan Milligan and George Rosevally, and a 
record setting third medal overall in this pool (2014, 2021, 2022).&nbsp; </p>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Nobody had Superbowl loser Cincinnati Bengals 
being in the Superbowl.&nbsp; So it was a year of big upsets.&nbsp; Larry J. 
Waldman, Brent Koplitz and Joe Milano needed a Cincy upset win to grab the 
medals, but the favored Rams held on for victory, giving the medals to Kevin 
Mulloy, Larry J. Waldman and Alex Bell.&nbsp; This was Kevin's first medal in 
this pool, and has moved him up from 24th to 16th on the all-time leaderboard.&nbsp; 
This was Larry J's second medal here, the first being a Bronze in 2012.&nbsp; He 
has moved back into the all-time Top Ten, going into 9th place and dropping Joe 
Milano and Steve Mayhew one notch each.&nbsp; Alex's Bronze was his second 
Bronze in a row in this pool, tying the record of two consecutive medals shared 
by Bob Waldman and Brent Koplitz.</p>

<span style="font-weight: 400">We lost five bowl games this year due to covid,

had about ten players hanging around near the top for most of the pool.&nbsp; No 
one clearly pulled ahead, so this came down to the championship game.&nbsp; If 
Alabama beat Georgia for the title then Mark Laffaye, Aaron Butcher and Barry 
Shuman would get the medals.&nbsp; But if Georgia could finally win a 
championship, then Shana Thomas, Mark Laffaye and Larry F. Waldman would take 
home the trophies.&nbsp; With a strong second half, Georgia managed to do it,

home the Gold.&nbsp; She becomes the 133rd member of the prestigious Waldarry 
Hall of Champions, and has the early lead for the rookie-of-the-year award.&nbsp; 
She enters the Hall in 69th place.&nbsp; Mark Laffaye took the Silver, his third 
Silver all-time over all pools, and his first award in this pool.&nbsp; Larry F. 
Waldman brought home the Bronze, which he also did in this pool in 2017. </p>

This pool had about six of us competitive toward the end of the season.&nbsp; 
Toronto was the only division leader that held on for most of the season.&nbsp; 
Washington and Pittsburgh were quite competitive, as were Vegas and Carolina.&nbsp; 
Brent Koplitz was our only contestant that did not pick Tampa Bay for first, 
giving him a big advantage when Carolina took that division.&nbsp; It came down 
to the last game of the season, where Brent needed a Colorado win to pass Vegas 
and take the Gold from Bob Waldman.&nbsp; Colorado won their finale, so Brent 
took the Gold, Bob took the Silver, and George Rosevally came away with the 
Bronze.&nbsp; These three actually tied for first, but they had three, two and 
one division champions respectively.&nbsp; This was Brent's first medal in this 
pool, Bob's second, and George's third.&nbsp; George also took the Bronze last 
year.</p>

fight it out for who got which medal.&nbsp; For the first time ever, we made it

Larry went down with the New Orleans Saints, yielding him the Bronze Medal.&nbsp; 
David and Christine went on to the conference championships in week 20and had to 
balance their pick versus being able to have a pick available for the Superbowl 
week 21 pick.&nbsp; Sadly, both went down in week 20, David's Green Bay pick 
losing to Tampa Bay by 5 points, while Christine's Buffalo got walloped by 
Kansas City by 14.&nbsp; That gave David the Gold and Christine the Silver.&nbsp; 
This was David's first ever medal in this pool, but made him a Gold Medal winner

acheive such notoriety.&nbsp; He moved up from 13th to 12th on the all-time

three to take the Silver, with Brent Koplitz carrying home the Bronze.&nbsp; It

This pool ran smack into the coronavirus pandemic of 2020.&nbsp; With about 85% 
of the season completed, play was halted and the standings were made official 
based upon the percentage of points earned against what was possible for each 
team's number of games played.&nbsp; Since the season was deemed official, our 
pool was deemed official as well.&nbsp; When three final adjustments were made 
based upon the number of games played by the teams, and our remaining four picks 
were made based upon maximizing each player's score, our medals wound up going 
to Pam Wood (Gold), Joe Milano (Silver) and George Rosevally (Bronze).&nbsp; 
This was Pam's record 11th Gold Medal overall, and her third medal in this pool 
(two earlier Bronze).&nbsp; Of even more import, this was Pam's third Gold Medal 
of the year, tying the record held by Michael Arvold and Bob Waldman.&nbsp; Joe earned his 8th Silver Medal and first ever medal 
in this pool.&nbsp; George's Bronze follows up his Silver in this pool in 2018.</p>

<span style="font-weight: 400">was (hopefully) a once-in-a-lifetime pool

It was run in the baseball format, but using the 30 Dow Jones Industrial stocks 
instead of the 30 MLB teams.&nbsp; It ran from late March through early July.&nbsp; 
James Waldron, Kevin and Casey Mulloy, Evans Boney and George Rosevally were 
early leaders and managed to stay at or near the top throughout the pool.&nbsp; 
James and George wound up getting all six division champions correct, leading 
them to first and second place finishes respectively.&nbsp; Evans faded near the 
end, and Casey overcame Kevin on the last day to grab third place.&nbsp; While 
James had the top spot wrapped up early, Intel passing Cisco on the last day 
clinched George and Kevin's positions.&nbsp; Given that this was not a true 
sports pool, it was not included in Waldarry all-time statistical reporting - it 
was treated like an all-star game.</span></span></font></span></p>

<p class="style7"><u>Summary</u>: We had 12 players pick heavily favored Houston 
to go all the way, with 3 picking the Dodgers, 2 the Yankees, and 1 each for 
Atlanta and wild-card Washington.&nbsp; Washington knocked out the Dodgers in 
the very first round, and then kept staging comebacks making it all the way to 
the World Series to face the Astros.&nbsp; The Astros had home-field advantage, 
and for the first time ever in any major sport, the road team won every game in 
a finals match-up.&nbsp; That made the Washington Nationals the champs in a 
7-game series.&nbsp; Larry F. Waldman was our only player to pick Washington to 
go all the way, leading him to the Gold Medal.&nbsp; Len Bergstrom, who gave the 
Nats 7 out of 8 points in the World Series round took the Silver, and Pam Wood 
grabbed the Bronze.&nbsp; Larry has tied Len with two Gold Medals in this pool, 
Len has extended his record to six all-time medals in this pool, and this was 
Pam's fourth medal in the pool.</p>

<div>
	<span class="style13">Summary</span>: Once again this pool has gone down to 
	a nail-biter final day of the season.&nbsp; For a long time it looked like 
	George Rosevally would be able to coast to the Gold, with Andreas Viglakis, 
	Alex Bell, Billy Waldman and Penny Bergstrom in a fight for the other two 
	medals.&nbsp; But then September came along.&nbsp; Milwaukee got red hot and 
	won 18 of 20, San Diego went ice cold and lost 15 of their last 17 games, 
	while last place Colorado won 11 of their final 18 games.&nbsp; This let 
	Colorado pass San Diego, knocking George out from contention.&nbsp; 
	Milwaukee's surge left Larry F,. Waldman and Pam Wood suddenly alive on the 
	final day.&nbsp; But the Cardinals hung on to keep first place from the 
	Brewers, knocking Larry F and Pam back out.&nbsp; Meanwhile the Yankees 
	sputtered at the end letting Houston grab the most wins with 107.&nbsp; This 
	gave us a three way tie with 138 points, 6 champions, and Houston with the 
	most wins.&nbsp; Andreas took the Gold with 102 predicted wins, Billy the 
	Silver with 100, and Alex the Bronze with 97.&nbsp; For Andreas this was his 
	second Gold of his rookie season (he took the NFL Survival pool early in the 
	year) but he just missed the Rookie-of-the-Year award by a fraction of a 
	point.&nbsp; Billy has won his sixth Silver and Alex has won his fourth 
	medal overall.&nbsp; For each of them it was their very first award in this 
	pool.&nbsp; <br />

<strong style="font-weight: 400"><u>Summary</u>:&nbsp;&nbsp; In week 5, Rob 
Grothe, in his first Waldarry pool ever, won the week and used that to take over 
our full season top position.&nbsp; He held first place for 10 of the final 13 
weeks,&nbsp;&nbsp; For the final 7 weeks it was Rob and Steve Mayhew slugging it 
out between the Gold and the Silver.&nbsp; It came down to the last week, where 
Steve made up 11 points on Rob, but that fell one point short.&nbsp; So Rob 
Grothe took the Gold and Steve Mayhew took the Silver.&nbsp; Alex Bell held 
third going into the last week, but Andreas Viglakis came up from 5th place to 
take the Bronze from him.&nbsp; Rob's win moved him up from 101st to 32nd on the 
all-time leaderboard, and made him a strong favorite for the 2020 
rookie-of-the-year award.&nbsp; Steve remains in 10th, but is now less than one 
point from 9th.&nbsp; Andreas moved up from 33rd to 29th.&nbsp; This was Steve's 
second Silver in this pool, his first being in 2011.&nbsp; </strong></em></font></p>

The Northern Trust Tournament (won by Barry Shuman) and the BMW Championship

Bergstrom won the final Tour tournament, but George Rosevally was able to pick 
up enough earnings in the first two tournaments to just edge out Len for the 
Waldarry Gold Medal.&nbsp; Len did grab the Silver, and Steve Mayhew had good 
finishes in all three tournaments to bring home the Bronze.&nbsp; This was 
George's third Gold Medal all-time, and Len's medal enabled him to tie Penny 
Bergstrom for the most total medals all-time at 31.5.&nbsp; Steve's Bronze gave 
him 10.34 Bronze Medals, second only to Bob Waldman's 10.5.</p>

the way and lost just one point in a first round series to get 63 of the

had Toronto with 15 in the final round) and Pat Laffaye grabbed the Bronze.&nbsp; 
Michael Arvold was the other contestant who picked the Raptors to win it all,

points to be competitive.&nbsp; For all three winners, this was their first 
medal in this pool.</p>

<span style="font-weight: 400">regular season runaway winner Tampa Bay to become 
the Stanley Cup Champions.&nbsp; Then in round 1 wild card Columbus took four 
straight from the Lightning to knock them right out of contention.&nbsp; Wow!&nbsp; 
Then to add to the mayhem, wild card Colorado took only five games to oust top 
seed Calgary, wild card Dallas took out top seed Nashville in six games, while 
wild card Carolina knocked off top seed Washington in seven games.&nbsp; So all 
four wild cards ousted all the top seeds.&nbsp; That was a first in NHL history.&nbsp; 
There were additional upsets as we moved through the rounds, leading to a finals 
matchup of the Boston Bruins (seeded 2) against the St. Louis Blues (seeded 3).&nbsp; 
It went the full seven games with the Blues taking home their first Stanley Cup 
ever, winning on Boston ice.&nbsp; Barry Shuman was able to raise the Waldarry 
Stanley Cup, having clinched the Gold even before the finals.&nbsp; Len 
Bergstrom grabbed the Silver and Bob Waldman took home the Bronze.&nbsp; This 
was Barry's first trophy in this pool, although he has taken two Golds in the 
regular season NHL pools.&nbsp; This win moved him up to second place in the 
all-time hockey standings, trailing only his son Devon by 0.85 points.&nbsp; For 
Len, he had just won the Gold in the NHL regular season, and now adds the Silver 
in the playoffs.&nbsp; Quite a showing for someone who never won a hockey award 
previously.&nbsp; Bob won his second Bronze in this pool, his first being in 
2014.</p>

For much of the latter part of the season Brandon Smyth and Larry J. Waldman 
showed the most strength and leadership.&nbsp; This became firm when Winnipeg 
took over the Central Division.&nbsp; But in the last couple of weeks Nashville 
came on really strong while Winnipeg struggled, and Nashville won their game on 
the last day to take the division by one point.&nbsp; Amazingly, on that last 
day of the season 15 of the 31 teams were still not locked into their position 
in the standings.&nbsp; Buffalo managed to pass Detroit by beating them 7-1 in a 
head-to-head game, which also influenced our final standings.&nbsp; Primarily 
based upon Nashville's resurgence, Len Bergstrom came up and took the Gold, 
Penny Bergstrom took the Bronze, and Brandon Smyth, even with his Winnipeg pick, 
managed to cling on for the Bronze. Early leader Larry J. faded all the way to 
6th place.&nbsp;&nbsp; For Len, this is his first ever NHL trophy.&nbsp; Penny 
earned her 4th trophy in this pool extending her own record, and Brandon also 
earned his first trophy in this pool, although he did win an NHL playoff trophy 
in 2017.</p>

reached that level.&nbsp; Barry Shuman and Pam Wood were perfect, picking the

to winning margin in the final game to break the 3-way tie.&nbsp; Charlie

	<span class="style13">Summary</span>: By mid-season this was becoming a 
	somewhat boring pool.&nbsp; The American League sorted itself out early, 
	with little close competition throughout the standings.&nbsp; The National 
	League also was somewhat dull.&nbsp; Alex Bell, Tyler Christofferson and 
	Penny Bergstrom seemed to have a good hold on the medal positions.&nbsp; 
	However, September brought along some huge National League surprises.&nbsp; 
	Washington came from 5.5 games back to take second place from the 
	Philadelphia.&nbsp; Milwaukee came from 4.5 games back to tie the Cubs for 
	first place.&nbsp; The Dodgers came from 2.5 back to pass Arizona and tie 
	Colorado for first place.&nbsp; These three combined changes let Bob 
	Waldman, Larry F. Waldman and James Waldron come up from the middle of the 
	pack to compete for medals.&nbsp; This became the first MLB season ever with 
	two 163rd game playoffs to determine division champions.&nbsp; The Brewers 
	beat the Cubs and the Dodgers beat the Rockies giving the Gold, Silver and 
	Bronze medals to Bob, Larry F. and James respectively.&nbsp; Larry edged 
	James by having six division champions to James' five.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	There were also three major records tied.&nbsp; Bob tied Penny Bergstrom 
	with nine Gold Medals all-time, and joined Michael Arvold (2016) to be the 
	only players to win three Gold Medals in one season.&nbsp; Larry tied the 
	record of four medals in one season, doing it for the second time (2015).&nbsp; 
	Joe Milano (also twice), Pam Wood and Penny Bergstrom also have won four 
	medals in one season.&nbsp; For James, this was his first Bronze Medal, 
	giving him one each of Gold, Silver and Bronze all time.</div>

Only four points separated our first from ninth places.&nbsp; There were two key 
NBA positions that made all the difference to us.&nbsp; Boston broke out to a 
large lead early in the season, and 13 of our 14 players gave them the first 
place slot in the Atlantic Division.&nbsp; Bob Waldman held out to pick Toronto 
in first late in the season after Toronto had displaced Boston.&nbsp; In the 
Northwest Division, Utah started off quite cold, and attracted last place picks 
from all but Bob, James Waldron and Pam Wood.&nbsp; Utah went on a roar late in 
the season and actually wound up challenging for the top spot before actually 
finishing third.&nbsp; The three players wound up correctly putting Denver in 
last place.&nbsp; Bob's double Toronto/Boston and Utah/Denver picks kept him at 
the top for most of the season, with James second.&nbsp; Pam Wood had a decent 
hold on third until the very last night, when an Oklahoma win combined with a 
Utah loss knocked her back and let Penny Bergstrom and Joe Milano each claim a 
share of the Bronze.&nbsp; Penny and Joe had identical picks all the way 
through, even to all the tiebreakers.&nbsp; Bob and James tied on top at 140, 
with Bob winning the tiebreaker with five correct champions to James' four.&nbsp; 
For Bob, this Gold was his fourth medal in the pool, and allowed him to become 
the 9th player to hit for the cycle in any pool (a Gold, Silver and Bronze in 
the same pool).&nbsp; Bob took his Gold in 2018, a Silver in 2009, and Bronze 
medals in 2011 and 2014.&nbsp; This was James' first Silver Medal in any pool, 
adding it to the Gold he took in the 2016 NBA Playoffs.&nbsp; This was Penny's 
record breaking 5th medal in this pool breaking a tie with Larry F. Waldman, and 
Joe's second medal in this pool (Silver in 2011).</p>

<strong style="font-weight: 400"><u>Summary</u>: </strong></em>
This was a most interesting season.&nbsp; Pittsburgh was expected to be one of 
the top teams, and expansion team Vegas was expected to be the worst.&nbsp; 
Seven of our players put Vegas last in the first week, and eleven put Pittsburgh 
first early on.&nbsp; Vegas roared out of the gate, and for the first time ever 
in any sport, an expansion team actually won their division!&nbsp; The Penguins 
dawdled near the bottom of their division before finally coming on strong, but 
not strong enough to catch Washington.&nbsp; Bob Waldman did not go with Vegas 
last or Pittsburgh first during the first part of the season and was able to use 
this to grab a big early lead.&nbsp; The rest of the field moved around a lot, 
with George Rosevally grabbing second place about 2/3 through the season.&nbsp; 
Third place was volatile, and going into the last night of the season it looked 
like Bob would win a close race against George, with Brandon Smyth grabbing the 
Bronze.&nbsp; But on the very last night Philadelphia, Columbus and New Jersey 
completely rearranged themselves to finish in that order with just a single 
point between all three.&nbsp; This enabled Larry F. Waldman to shoot up from 
his hidden 7th place position and run off with the Bronze.&nbsp; Nobody saw this 
coming, and it was quite a surprise even to him.&nbsp; Bob did indeed hold onto 
the Gold getting only his second NHL award ever, having taken the Bronze in the 
2014 playoffs.&nbsp; George's Silver was his first hockey award, and Larry won 
his second straight Bronze in this pool.</font></span></p>

finisher Jordan Spieth and fifth finisher Rory McIlroy it drove Blake to our

Johnson was enough to earn him our top spot.&nbsp; Brent Koplitz was one of five 
players to pick Francesco Molinari to win the British Open, and having all five 
of his picks finish in the top twelve brought him the victory.&nbsp; Brent then 
did it again in the PGA, where he was one of seven players to pick winner Brooks 
Koepka (the US Open winner as well).&nbsp; Brent also had second place Tiger 
Woods and sixth place Francesco Molinari to clinch his win.&nbsp; Brent set 
several important Waldarry records in this pool.&nbsp; His $9.4M winnings broke 
SJ Tuohy's 2017 record of $8.1M, and Brent became our first player to ever win 
two tournaments doing them in the same year consecutively!&nbsp; This is Brent's 
sixth Gold Medal, it is Bill's first ever Silver Medal (although he does have 
five Gold Medals to his credit), and Alex's Bronze gives him a Gold, Silver and

	Erin Mulloy was our only player who selected the Netherlands, and 
	they got off to a strong start.&nbsp; This let Erin lead the pack for the 
	first quarter of the competition.&nbsp; Then Norway and Germany came 
	streaming forward, allowing George Rosevally, Ryan Milligan and Mike Defede 
	(our triplets who all had the exact same picks) to forge to the front.&nbsp; 
	As we approached the mid-point, Joe Milano leveraged France, Italy and 
	Slovakia, in addition to Norway and Germany, to grab the top position.&nbsp; 
	From that point forward Joe and the triplets maintained the top four 
	positions.&nbsp; At times Joe was ahead, and at times they were tied.&nbsp; 
	But Joe owned the first tie-breaker (seven countries chosen versus six), so 
	he was in the number one position throughout.&nbsp; The triplets had to 
	break their tie using the number of points for the leading country.&nbsp; 
	George had 119, Ryan 118 and Mike 115.&nbsp; Norway was at 118 going into 
	the final day and pulled off a Gold to reach 123, making the order George, 
	Ryan and Mike.&nbsp; Hence Joe got the Gold, George the Silver and Ryan the 
	Bronze.&nbsp; Poor Mike got left out in the cold.&nbsp; For Joe this was his 
	fifth Gold Medal of all-time, and first ever medal in an Olympics.&nbsp; 
	George also grabbed his first Olympic medal, and fifth Silver all-time.&nbsp; 
	Ryan's Bronze followed his winning the Gold in the last Olympics, summer of 
	2016.&nbsp; He ties Pam Wood winning for consecutive medals in the Olympics

This was a most unusual pool as 8 of our 18 contestants lost only one point in 
the first round and then had identical correct picks the rest of the way 
resulting in Golden State beating Cleveland in the finals.&nbsp; So much for a 
balanced league.&nbsp; We wound up with an eight way tie at the top, having to 
go to tie-breakers for final resolution.&nbsp; The Warriors won in five games.&nbsp; 
Penny Bergstrom was the only player to choose five games and hence took home the 
Gold.&nbsp; Bob Waldman had 4 games and Lucca Rivera, Steve Mayhew and Pam Wood 
had 6 games, causing us to look at final game winning margin.&nbsp; Steve had 2, 
Pam 3, Lucca 4 and Bob 14.&nbsp; The actual result was 9 points so Bob and Lucca 
split the Silver and Bronze.&nbsp; It is interesting to note that in the eleven 
years of this pool we have had eleven different Gold Medal winners.&nbsp; Penny 
has now tied Pam Wood with 8 all-time Gold Medals.&nbsp; She has also become the 
tenth player to "hit for the cycle" in a pool, having taken the Gold in 2017, 
Silver in 2008 and Bronze in 2011.&nbsp; Steve Mayhew has also hit for the cycle 
in this pool.&nbsp; Additionally, Penny has extended her record to six years in 
a row winning a Gold (2012 to 2017).&nbsp; For Bob, this was his first medal in 
this pool.&nbsp; Lucca won the Bronze in 2014.</p>

gave him total 2017 earnings of a record $8.1M, about $1.3M greater than Blake

raises him from 64th to 46th on the all-time leaderboard, and Kevin has won the

North Carolina had the most picks from us (12), and Gonzaga was tied with Kansas

finals.&nbsp; Both were number one seeds.&nbsp; Pam Wood needed a Gonzaga win to

Carolina won in the last couple of minutes, 71-65, giving Mike the Gold and Alex 
Bell the Silver.&nbsp; For both players it was their first ever Waldarry medals, 
and makes them the 109th and 110th members in the Waldarry Hall of Champions.&nbsp; 
Veteran Steve Mayhew took the Bronze after taking the Silver in this pool ten

<p class="style7"><u>Summary</u>: This was a most exciting year for baseball.&nbsp; 
The World Series came down to the Cubs, who had not won a title in 108 years, 
against the Indians who had a drought of 68 years.&nbsp; The Cubs had a good 
team and were the most picked by our players with seven selecting them to go all 
the way.&nbsp; Cleveland had two picks to go the full route.&nbsp; Penny 
Bergstrom (picking Chicago) and George Rosevally (with Cleveland) fought for the 
Gold, with the loser getting the Bronze.&nbsp; Steve Mayhew needed the Cubs for 
the Silver and David Blamphin needed the Indians.&nbsp; The tribe went up 3 
games to 1, but the Cubs got it to a seventh game in Cleveland, and then it went 
to extra innings.&nbsp; It even included a rain delay after nine innings.&nbsp; 
In the tenth the Cubs scored twice and Cleveland only got one, so an 8-7 victory 
gave the Cubs their first championship in 108 years!&nbsp; That made our winners 
Penny, Steve and George.&nbsp; It was Penny's fourth 2016 medal win tying the 
all-time record for a year.&nbsp; It was also her 7th Gold Medal all-time tying 
Pam Wood for that honor.&nbsp; Steve completed a trifecta for this pool, having 
taken the Gold in 2013 and the Bronze in 2008.&nbsp; This was George's first 
medal for this pool!</p>

<p class="style7"><b>&nbsp; 1st Place</b> - Joe Milano (146/150)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<span style="font-weight: 700">2nd Place</span><b> </b>- Len Bergstrom (146/150)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(146/150)</p>
<div>
	<span class="style13">Summary</span>: This was a close exciting season that 
	came down to the very last day.&nbsp; Bob Waldman needed a San Diego win in 
	its final three game series against Arizona to insure a Gold or Silver 
	medal.&nbsp; They lost all three.&nbsp; Chad Martin needed a Toronto loss on 
	the final day to grab the Gold.&nbsp; Toronto won.&nbsp; This set up a four 
	way tie for the top spot between Joe Milano, Len Bergstrom, Larry J. Waldman 
	and Evans Boney.&nbsp; All had five of the six division champions correct.&nbsp; 
	The first three correctly had the Cubs with the most wins, but Evans had the 
	Dodgers so he was eliminated.&nbsp; The Cubs had 103 wins, so Joe took the 
	Gold with a projected 95 wins, Len the Silver with 94, and Larry the Bronze 
	with 93.&nbsp; It does not get much closer.&nbsp; The leading score of 146 
	points blew away the prior record of 140 set in 2013 by the very same Joe 
	and Larry J.&nbsp; This was Joe's record tying fourth medal in this pool, 
	and Len's record-tying third straight year winning a medal in this pool 
	(tying Bill Brewster from 2010 to 2012).&nbsp; This was Larry J's second 
	medal in this pool, having taken the Gold in 2013.<br />

<strong style="font-weight: 400"><u>Summary</u>: This was an exciting season for 
us, as we had a real dogfight for first place between Bobbie Arvold and David 
Leib, and an equally hard fight for third among a handful of players.&nbsp; 
Bobbie took over the top spot in the third week of the season, and by week seven 
David Leib had climbed into second place.&nbsp; It stayed that way until a 
weekly win in week 13 by David propelled him to take the lead from Bobbie.&nbsp; 
David hung on until the very last week of the season when Bobbie was able to 
squeak back past him and take the season by four points.&nbsp; Quite a one-two 
throughout the season.&nbsp; Third place was another story.&nbsp; Kevin Mulloy 
looked strong early, but in week 11 Len Bergstrom took over the spot.&nbsp; 
Others in the scramble included Chris Green, Sue Friborg, and Mark Laffaye.&nbsp; 
When the dust had cleared, Chris Green eked out the Bronze by one point over 
Sue Friborg, two points over Mark Laffaye, and three points over Len Bergstrom.&nbsp; 
For Bobbie Arvold, this is her first Waldarry Gold ever, having won the Bronze 
in this pool in 2010.&nbsp; She has moved up from 49th to 17th place on the all-time 
leaderboard.&nbsp; David Leib has now "hit for the circuit" in this pool, having 
taken the Gold in 2013, the Silver now, and the Bronze in 2015.&nbsp; Chris 
Green, a Waldarry rookie, is honored to become the 107th member of the fabled 
Waldarry Hall of Champions, entering in 72nd place!&nbsp; Finally, there were three double weekly winners this season - Kevin 
Mulloy, Luca Guyer and Noe Nalvarte.</strong></em></font></p>

Pam Wood, Len Bergstrom and Ryan Milligan started a push upward at about the 
halfway point.&nbsp; Around the three quarter mark Penny nudged husband Len 
aside and Pam, Ryan and Penny took the lead.&nbsp; They held the top three spots 
from that point forward.&nbsp; At the 90% mark Ryan began pulling away from the 
other two, and in the end he took the Gold by 43 points.&nbsp; Penny took the 
Silver with Pam just one point behind her for the Bronze.&nbsp; Billy Waldman 
came on strong right at the end to miss the Bronze by just one point.&nbsp; This 
was Ryan's third Gold Medal overall, and Penny's record setting 10th Silver 
Medal.&nbsp; Pam took the Silver Medal in the 2014 Winter Olympics, so she is 
the first Waldarry Olympics double medal winner!</p>

took a 3-1 lead, one never overcome in the history of the finals.&nbsp; But 
LeBron James was not to be denied, and he mustered up whatever it took to drive 
Cleveland to their first ever NBA Championship.&nbsp; Our three players that

Their tie was broken by the winning margin in the final game, 4 points, with Len 
having 6 and Brent having 8.&nbsp; Len and Brent are both long-time Waldarry

for the Sharks, held on for the Bronze.&nbsp; Brent Koplitz also had Pittsburgh 
winning the Cup, but had many wrong picks earlier and could&nbsp; not reach 
medal territory.&nbsp; This pool presented an historic event for Waldarry Sports 
Pools.&nbsp; Michael Arvold's Gold gave him the first ever Waldarry Golden Hat 
Trick - three Gold Medals in one calendar year!&nbsp; Michael won the Gold in 
the NFL regular season pool, NCAA March Madness, and this Stanley Cup playoff 
pool.&nbsp; Eleven players had shared the record of two Gold Medals in one year.&nbsp; 
This was also Michael's second Gold Medal in this pool (he also won it in 2010), 
tying Devon Shuman for that honor.&nbsp; For Connie Mulloy, this was her second 
major medal, having taken the Gold in the 2013 NFL playoff pool.&nbsp; Joel 
Leger's Bronze was his first ever Waldarry Medal, making him the 102nd member

second, allowed her to take the PGA title.&nbsp; For the full majors, Aaron 
Butcher proved the most consistent, taking a 2nd place, 3rd place, 10th place and 
7th place, to total $5.9 million dollars of earnings and bring home the Gold.&nbsp; 
Billy Waldman managed a 3rd, 5th, 3rd and then fell to 18th, hanging on for the 
Silver with $5.3 million in earnings.&nbsp; Kevin Mulloy used his Masters win 
plus a 23rd, 21st, and a then a recovering 2nd place in the PGA to bring him 
back up to grab the Bronze Medal.&nbsp; It was a good first competitive foray 
into the world of golf for the Waldarry players.</strong></em></font></span></p>

<strong style="font-weight: 400"><u>Summary</u>: </strong>
<span style="font-weight: 400">This was a very easy season to make picks until 
the last couple of weeks, at which time it became ridiculously difficult.&nbsp; 
The badly off-balanced NBA made it fairly easy to place teams as they fell into 
their slots readily as the season progressed.&nbsp; As late as three weeks to 
go, we still had 12 of our 15 players with the potential to earn a medal.&nbsp; 
In the end it came down to Indiana and Detroit fighting for second place in the 
Central, and Miami, Atlanta and Charlotte all fighting for the top spot in the 
Southeast.&nbsp; By the last day the big games involved Miami vs. Boston and 
Atlanta vs. Washington to decide on their division championship.&nbsp; David 
Blamphin needed a Miami success for the Gold, and Penny Bergstrom needed 
Atlanta.&nbsp; Atlanta needed a Miami loss and an Atlanta win to take it, and 
anything else gave it to Miami.&nbsp; Miami was 24 points ahead of Boston 
</span></em></font></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400">at halftime, and then collapsed to lose by 10.&nbsp; 
Atlanta just needed to take out Washington, but they managed to lose by 11.&nbsp; 
So Miami wound up on top of what turned out to be a three-way tie (with 
Charlotte in there as well).&nbsp; This gave David the Gold, with Penny picking 
up the Silver and Larry F. Waldman earning the Bronze.</p>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Once again the NHL had a very dynamic season, 
with early leaders fading sharply, and teams moving significantly up and down 
the ladder during the season.&nbsp; We mirrored that closely, with some of our 
early bottom dwellers rising to the top, and early leaders fading to the bottom.&nbsp; 
It was about mid-season that Barry Shuman took over our top spot, and although 
it was often close, he never let go of it.&nbsp; Pam Wood had been languishing 
at the bottom of the pack early, and made a late push to get into contention.&nbsp; 
The two Bergstroms were in the fight all along, as was Billy Waldman.&nbsp; But 
in the end, Barry took the Gold as expected, Penny Bergstrom took the Silver, 
and Pam won a tie-breaker versus Len Bergstrom to take the Bronze.&nbsp; </span>
</span></font></span><span style="font-style: normal">
<span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp; For Barry this is his record-setting 
second Gold Medal in this pool, his first being two years ago.&nbsp; Penny won

last year.&nbsp; And for Pam this was also her second regular season hockey

down to a three point buzzer-beater for Villanova to take a 77-74 win for the 
Trophy.&nbsp; Michael Arvold was our only player to pick Villanova to go all the 
way, and leveraged this for the Waldarry Gold.&nbsp; Evans Boney had the correct 
teams in the finals, but had Villanova losing to North Carolina.&nbsp; This was 
still good enough for Evans to take home the Silver.&nbsp; Finally, Kevin 
Mulloy, who had Villanova losing a round too early, had North Carolina in the 
finals and managed to squeak out the Bronze.&nbsp; For Michael Arvold this was 
his second Gold of this year, fifth all-time, and propelled him up to second 
place on the all-time leaderboard.&nbsp; Evans Boney earned his first Silver 
Medal ever, and for Kevin Mulloy it was his second Bronze Medal.</p>

<span style="font-style: normal">
<span style="font-weight: 400">We had a record 44 players in the pool this year, 
with 14 picking Carolina as champs, 7 taking each of Seattle, Arizona and New 
England, and 6 picking Denver.&nbsp; A couple of other teams got a small amount 
of votes as well.&nbsp; Unusually, the visiting teams (lower seeds) won each of 
the wild card games.&nbsp; But after that, the favorites won all the way to the 
Superbowl.&nbsp; That left the two top seeds, Denver and Carolina to go for the 
Championship, with the Panthers and Cam Newton being the 5.5 point favorites 
over the Broncos and Peyton Manning.</span></span></font></span><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp; 
For us, rookie Mark Laffaye was lined up for the Gold if Carolina came away 
victorious, and that would be the first ever perfect 48 point score in this 
pool.&nbsp; Mike Defede, David Guyer and Michael Arvold would vie for the Silver 
and Bronze based upon the final game score.&nbsp; On the other hand, if Denver 
could pull off the upset, then Larry F. Waldman would claim the Gold, with Phil 
Suraci the Silver and either of two rookies, Bill Minty or Oliver Guyer, taking 
the Bronze based upon the final score.&nbsp; In the end, the Denver defense 
proved too much for the powerful Carolina offense, and Denver came away with a 
24-10 victory.&nbsp; Larry's Gold was his second award in this pool, having 
taken the Silver in 2009.&nbsp; It also gave Larry his first ever showing in the 
coveted Waldarry All-Time Top Ten in the Waldarry Hall of Champions.&nbsp; For 
Phil this is his first Silver Award, following a Bronze in the 2014 March 
Madness pool.&nbsp; Oliver Guyer took the Bronze based upon his lower total 
score pick for the Superbowl, and becomes the 101st member in the Waldarry Hall 
of Champions!</p>

pick with seven selections, closely followed by the Dodgers with six.&nbsp; The 
Dodgers went down in the first round to the Mets, and Kansas City wiped out 
Toronto in the second round.&nbsp; The World Series came down to the Mets and 
the Royals.&nbsp; Two players had the Royals going all the way and one had the

champs.&nbsp; Larry F. Waldman and Joyce Fubini had identical picks throughout,

Larry had a 6 game World Series and Joyce had 7, so Larry brought home the Gold

<span style="font-weight: 400">This was an amazingly short season.&nbsp; It 
didn't look that way after the first week, when only one of 45 players was 
eliminated.&nbsp; But week 2 was a killer, with the top five favored NFL teams 
all losing.&nbsp; Only three players escaped that wrath, Aaron Butcher, David 
Blamphin and Shannon Mulloy.&nbsp; So the three award winners were determined 
after just two weeks!&nbsp; Shannon went down to defeat in week 5, leaving her 
with the Bronze.&nbsp; </span></span></font></span>
<span style="font-style: normal">
<span style="font-weight: 400">A week later an Arizona loss sent David to the 
Silver, with a New England win giving the Gold to Aaron.&nbsp; This is Aaron's 
first Gold Medal ever, adding to a Silver he won in this same pool three years 
ago.&nbsp; The medal ties Aaron with four other players who have won two medals 
in this pool.&nbsp; For David it is his fourth medal overall, and his first in an NFL 
pool.&nbsp; It is Shannon's first medal, although she does have two weekly NFL 
wins to her credit.&nbsp; A surprisingly fast pool, but one that did provide 
lots of excitement for its three finalists.</p>

down to the very last game of the season!&nbsp; For the prior four weeks, Dan 
Cissell and Michael Arvold held the top two spots, with Dan ahead in three of 
the four weeks.&nbsp; It took until week 12 for Rhonda Tenenbaum to enter the 
top ten, but she worked her way up to third in a fight against Ali Jian, Bobbie 
Arvold, Bill Brewster and Pam Wood.&nbsp; The very last game of the season 
pitted favored Green Bay against Minnesota.&nbsp; A Green Bay win would give the 
Gold to Dan, and a Minnesota upset would give it to Michael.&nbsp; Michael 
picked the Vikings to win the game, as they are his favorite team.&nbsp; His 
faithfulness paid off, as the Vikings prevailed, giving our Gold, Silver and 
Bronze to Michael Arvold, Dan Cissell and Rhonda Tenenbaum respectively.&nbsp; 
This is Michael's first full-season medal in this pool (he has five weekly wins 
to his credit).&nbsp; It is his fourth Gold Medal over all pools.&nbsp; Dan adds 
this Silver to the Gold he won in this pool in 2010.&nbsp; For rookie Rhonda, 
this is her first ever Waldarry award, making her the 100th player inducted into 
the fabled Waldarry Hall of Champions!&nbsp; There were three double week 
winners this year - Katie Beltrone, Andrew Wang and Matt Kopchick.&nbsp; For 
Katie, Andrew, and Luca Guyer (as well as Rhonda), this pool provided their 
initial induction into the Waldarry Hall of Champions.</strong></em></font></p>

perfect set of picks.&nbsp; Since Esteban forecast the Warriors in six and Billy 
had them in seven, Esteban took the tie-breaker to get the Gold, with Billy 
pulling in the Silver.&nbsp; Steve Mayhew, at 62 points took the Bronze.&nbsp; 
Esteban enters the Waldarry Hall of Champions in style with a Gold, becoming the 
Hall's 95th member.&nbsp; For Billy this is his 16th trophy overall, but first 
ever in this pool.&nbsp; Steve, who took the Gold in this pool last year, has

the second year in a row, not one player picked the ultimate winner.&nbsp; 
Chicago beat Tampa Bay for the championship.&nbsp; One player (Larry F. Waldman) 
had Tampa Bay picked, and none had the Blackhawks.&nbsp; In the end, the Gold 
was a contest between Blake Oakes needing Tampa Bay (he had much stronger 
earlier picks than Larry), and Pam Wood needing Chicago.&nbsp; So Pam came away 
with our version of the Stanley Cup, with Joe Milano taking the Silver and David 
Blamphin the Bronze.&nbsp; This was Pam's first trophy in this pool, but is her 
sixth Waldarry Gold, tying her with Bob Waldman for the most Gold Medals ever 
earned.&nbsp; It was Joe's second trophy in this pool, having taken the Gold in 
2011.&nbsp; It was his 19th trophy overall, passing Len Bergstrom for the second 
most behind Pam Wood's 24.&nbsp; For David Blamphin this was his first Bronze 
Medal, but he already has a Gold and a Silver in other pools, so he has now hit 
for the cycle.&nbsp; It is interesting to note that Devon Shuman, the perennial 
hero in this pool, actually finished tied for second, but fell to fourth based 
upon tie-breakers.&nbsp; It would have been his fifth year in a row taking a 
trophy in this pool.</p>

and the final order was also critical to us.&nbsp; Penny Bergstrom, Ryan 
Milligan and Larry F. Waldman all had a shot at the Gold depending on how those 
three teams wound up.&nbsp; Lots of hot TV watching that night.&nbsp; San 
Antonio lost, while Houston and Memphis won, giving a final order of Houston, 
Memphis and San Antonio.&nbsp; This set up a wild five way tie at the top of our 
standings.&nbsp; Len Bergstrom was quickly eliminated as he had only four 
correct champs while the other four players had five.&nbsp; Penny and Larry had 
the Clippers with the most wins, while Ryan and Brent Koplitz had Cleveland.&nbsp; 
The Clippers won 56 to Cleveland's 53, so Penny and Larry were still tied.&nbsp; 
Penny's 58 wins prediction was closer than Larry's 61, so she took the Gold 
while Larry took the Silver.&nbsp; Ryan's 60 wins for Cleveland was closer than 
Brent's 65, so Ryan took the Bronze.&nbsp; A spectacular final night that led to 
third level tie-breakers for all medals!&nbsp; This was Penny's third Gold Medal 
in this pool breaking the tie she had with Enrique Rivera at two.&nbsp; For 
Larry, this was his third overall Medal in this pool, putting him in a tie with 
Penny, Enrique and Bob Waldman.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ryan, last year's Gold Medal 
winner had a shot at being the first consecutive Gold Medal winner, but had to 
settle for a Bronze.&nbsp; </p>

shootout, giving them the top spot, and giving Steve, Ryan and Penny the medals.&nbsp; 
Steve's Gold was his fourth Gold Medal, and allowed him to move up from 10th 
place to 7th place on the prestigious Top Ten.&nbsp; Ryan actually tied Steve on 
points, but wound up with the Silver as his Blackhawks had only 102 points 
compared to Steve's Montreal pick netting 110.&nbsp; For Ryan, this was his 
fourth Medal, now having two Golds and two Silvers.&nbsp; He moved up one notch

third spot, but she had two division champions correct to Larry's one.&nbsp;

Baltimore and St. Louis were the favorites to reach the World Series, and 
neither made it.&nbsp; Both lost early, and the two wild-card game winners, the 
Kansas City Royals and the San Francisco Giants made it all the way to the World 
Series.&nbsp; The finals went the full seven games, with the Giants taking a 3-2 
win to give them their third championship in five years.&nbsp; None of our 
players correctly had the Giants beating the Royals in the finals.&nbsp; Barry 
Shuman and Len Bergstrom, who both had the Royals and Giants reaching the World 
Series, but incorrectly had the Royals taking it, finished in the top two spots.&nbsp; 
The Bronze went to Michael Arvold, who did indeed have the Giants taking the 
title, but had them beating Baltimore, not Kansas City.&nbsp; All in all some 
pretty poor results for our participants, but that&#39;s what happens with a few 
major upsets.&nbsp; For Barry, this is his third Gold Medal.&nbsp; It is Len&#39;s 
seventh Silver, and Michael now has 3.5 Bronze Medals.&nbsp; Another pool where 
three veterans show they have not lost any of their talents!</p>

most of the interesting action, with the bottoms and tops well established.&nbsp; 
Late in the season Ryan Milligan, Len Bergstrom and Bob Waldman started to show 
strength at the top of our standings.&nbsp; There was a lot of back and forth, 
and believe it or not, the Gold was not determined until the <em>final game</em> 
on the <em>final night</em> of the season.&nbsp; Ryan needed a Memphis win over 
Dallas, and Len needed a Dallas win over Memphis.&nbsp; To add to the amazement 
of this last minute finish the game actually went into overtime!&nbsp; Memphis 
pulled it out by one point to give Ryan the coveted Gold Medal.&nbsp; Len, Bob 
and George Rosevally tied for second.&nbsp; They all had either Miami or Houston 
with the best record, and that too came down to the final night with the teams 
exactly tying in their season record.&nbsp; Len took the Bronze based on his 
forecasted number of wins, and Bob took the Bronze based on his forecast.&nbsp;

Bob being frequent visitors to the Hall of Champions.</p>

This was a rough year for the NCAA bracket players.&nbsp; Of our record 55 
players in the pool, we had 21 who picked favorite Florida to go all the way.&nbsp; 
First seeded Florida did make it to the Final Four, but lost there to seventh 
seeded Connecticut.&nbsp; On the other side of the bracket 2nd seed Wisconsin 
lost by one point to 8th seed Kentucky, setting up the Connecticut vs. Kentucky 
Final.&nbsp; This was the highest number total seed ever for a March Madness 
final, 7th against 8th.&nbsp; In one of the most amazing selections in Waldarry 
Pool history, Joyce Fubini actually had Connecticut playing Kentucky in the 
Finals, which gave her the easy Gold Medal in the pool this year.&nbsp; Brendan 
Hansen had Florida and Wisconsin in the Final Four which helped him land the 
Silver, and Phil Suraci had only Florida, but did have five of the Elite Eight 
correct to grab the Bronze.&nbsp; For Joyce, this was her second Gold Medal, the 
first being in the 2009 NHL playoffs.&nbsp; This was Brendan&#39;s first entry into 
the Waldarry Hall of Champions, becoming its 87th member.&nbsp; Phil Suraci has 
won five weekly NFL competitions, with this being his first full season medal.&nbsp; 
Although it had no effect on our pool, Connecticut went on to beat Kentucky and 
become national champions.</p>

up to the top based on strong showings from Switzerland and Sweden.&nbsp; Then 
some surprising strength from Belarus helped Brent open up a commanding 49 point 
lead at the 60% point in the Olympics.&nbsp; At that point it became a contest 
for the Silver and Bronze, with Pam, Joe, Mike and Ryan in close contention.&nbsp; 
Finland and Slovenia helped Pam get a decent grip on the Silver, and Joe had the 
Bronze at the start of the final day.&nbsp; But Latvia came through with a 
bobsledding Silver and the three points set up a three way tie between Joe, Mike 
and Ryan.&nbsp; Mike and Ryan beat Joe because they used more countries in their 
pick set.&nbsp; For Mike and Ryan it came down to the leading country&#39;s score as 
a tie-breaker, and Mike&#39;s 108 prediction was just one point off of Russia&#39;s

	<span class="style13">Summary</span>: This was a tough season with some 
	really big surprises in the standings - the biggest being the Red Sox 
	finishing last and the Orioles finishing second.&nbsp; Philly was also a big 
	disappointment finishing third.&nbsp; All of these surprises helped keep our 
	season very fluid, with 12 of our 13 players being in medal-winning 
	territory at some time during the season.&nbsp; Bill Brewster spent the 
	first half of the season near the bottom of the pack, and then began a slow 
	ascent upwards, ultimately finishing on top.&nbsp; Penny Bergstrom and Larry 
	J. Waldman were in the middle most of the season and also bubbled up&nbsp; 
	near the end.&nbsp; Larry actually was part of a five-way tie for third, 
	taking the tiebreaker by having the Tigers with the most wins and a closer 
	number of wins than Joe Milano.&nbsp; It is interesting to note that Bill 
	and Penny also took the Gold and Bronze last year, and for Bill this is his 
	third straight Gold in this pool - an all-time record for such a repeat 
	performance.&nbsp; He must really know his 
	baseball!&nbsp; Additionally, this is Bill&#39;s fifth Gold Medal of all time 
	(covering all pools), tying him with Pam Wood for the most in that category.<br />

Our leaders changed frequently throughout the season, until with about a month 
to go Larry F. Waldman took the lead and pretty much was able to hang on and

season, and a Raptors win over the Nets gave those trophies to Jon Etheart and 
George Rosevally over Steve Mayhew and Joe Milano.&nbsp; We actually wound up 
with a four way tie at the top with 138 points.&nbsp; Larry took the Gold with 
all six division champions picked correctly, Jon the Silver with Chicago having 
more wins than Miami, and George took the Bronze over Steve by having the closer 
number of wins for Miami.&nbsp;&nbsp; For Larry, this is his eighth trophy, but 
his very first Gold award.&nbsp; Jon made a big splash, as this was his very 
first Waldarry Pool - not many rookies grab a trophy in their maiden effort.&nbsp; 
For George, this is his second Bronze award, to add to a Gold and a Silver in 
his repertoire.</font></span></p>

Orleans, and the rest were split between Baltimore and New England.&nbsp; New 
England did indeed make it to the Superbowl, but they were beaten there by the 
upstart New York Giants, who no player even had winning the second round of the 
playoffs.&nbsp; Bill Brewster had New York with seven points in the Superbowl 
round, enough to propel him to the Gold.&nbsp; Penny Bergstrom&#39;s six Giants 
points in the final round and some good earlier picks earned her the Silver, and 
Larry J. Waldman parlayed </strong></em>the Giants&#39; win into a Bronze.&nbsp;

	But Bill correctly had the Phillies with the most wins, Penny took second

	this is his second year in a row winning the Gold in this pool, and his

point total score.&nbsp; In the tie-breakers, both correctly has a six game 
series, but Sheel&#39;s nine point margin in the final game was closer than Joyce&#39;s 
five point projection (Dallas won the last game by 10), so Sheel walked off with

It came down to the last night of the season, with Len Bergstrom needing a 
Memphis win over the Clippers to take the Gold.&nbsp; Alas, the Clips won by 
seven, and Len wound up tied for fourth.&nbsp; Enrique Rivera took the Gold with 
a perfect set of picks except for inverting the Clippers and the Kings at the

Waldman and Joe Milano tied for second, also inverting Utah and Portland in the

&nbsp;The Gold Medal this year has once again gone to Pam Wood, who has now 
taken this pool for three of the last four years - a rather amazing feat.&nbsp; 
While Michael Arvold held the top spot for the first ten weeks, Pam took it away 
in week 11.&nbsp; From week 13 until the end, Pam and Steve Mayhew went back and 
forth in the top two spots.&nbsp; Pam had a good last week and used that to nip 
Steve by just two points for the season title.&nbsp; In the meantime, Waldarry 
rookie (and certainly the rookie-of-the-year!) Amir Avraham used a great week 15 
to make his first appearance in the top ten, and then vaulted into third place 
for the last two weeks to bring home the Bronze.&nbsp; Another interesting note 
is that Chad Martin was our only repeat winner during the year, taking weeks 7 
and 13.&nbsp; He finished sixth overall.&nbsp; A great season, and congrats to 
our trophy winners!</p>

<span style="font-weight: 700">3rd Place</span> - Bob Waldman 
(27/45)</p>
<p class="style7"><u>Summary</u>: In our best performance ever in this pool, 
Larry Byers pulled in 43 of the possible 45 points.&nbsp; He correctly had Texas 
in 6 in the ALCS, had the Giants in 7 in the NLCS (they won in 6), and again 
correctly had the Giants in 5 in the World Series.&nbsp; An absolutely 
phenomenal performance to take home the Gold.&nbsp; Barry Shuman was no slacker 
either, as he took the Silver, having the same forecasts for the first two 
series, but choosing one too many games for the World Series.&nbsp; After these 
two, it was something of a disaster.&nbsp; All other players had Philly winning 
in the NLCS, and 13 of the 19 of us had the Yankees taking the ALCS.&nbsp; This 
allowed Bob Waldman to sneak in for the Bronze, with a correct Texas in 6, and a 
National League in 6 in the World Series.&nbsp; For Larry Byers, this Gold is a 
follow-up to his shared Bronze in the MLB regular season, which was his maiden 
entry in the Hall of Champions.&nbsp; This is Barry&#39;s first Silver, to go with a 
Gold and two Bronze awards, and for Bob it is his 3rd Bronze and tenth trophy 
overall.&nbsp; This was a tough pool to call, and at least the top two guys did 
a great job!</p>

<div>
	<span class="style13">Summary</span>: This was a very exciting pool.&nbsp; 
	There was not a lot of variation in the picks, so it was a close pool all 
	the way.&nbsp; On the final day of the season it was still possible for six 
	different players to wind up taking medals.&nbsp; In any event, Bill 
	Brewster, who was at or near the top the entire season, hung on to take the 
	Gold.&nbsp; He had two correct division winners, the Twins and the Phillies, 
	and nobody had more.&nbsp; He had the NL East picked perfectly, and forecast 
	the number of wins within 10 for 23 of the 30 teams.&nbsp; Joyce Fubini took 
	second, with the same two division winners.&nbsp; There was a three way tie 
	for third between Len Bergstrom, Larry Byers, and Larry J. Waldman.&nbsp; 
	Len and Larry Byers shared the Medal, as they had the same two division 
	winners, while Larry J. only had Philly.&nbsp; It is interesting to note 
	that none of our contestants picked any of the other four division winners - 
	Tampa Bay, Texas, Cincinnati, or San Francisco.&nbsp; For Bill Brewster this 
	is his first Gold Medal, and first Medal other than four weekly winners in 
	the NFL Pick &#39;Em Pool.&nbsp; This is Joyce&#39;s second Silver Medal, in 
	addition to one Gold in her portfolio.&nbsp; Len adds to his collection of 
	eight Medals, and has moved up from fourth to third on the all-time 
	Leaderboard.&nbsp; And finally, we welcome Larry Byers into the Hall with 
	his initial trophy, one half of the Bronze Medal.&nbsp; Congrats to all!<br />

finals with the heavily favored Kobe-led Lakers.&nbsp; We had four players with 
the Lakers, and one (Enrique Rivera) with his beloved Celtics.&nbsp; Boston took 
a 3-2 lead, and then needed one of two in LA.&nbsp; They lost the first badly, 
but then went down to the final minute of game seven, falling four points short 
in the end.&nbsp; LA&#39;s victory gave the Gold to Pat Laffaye, who won the 
tie-breaker with Steve Mayhew by giving LA the full 16 points in the Final.&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">This pool got off to a very quick start.&nbsp; 
Thirteen of our seventeen players picked top seeded Washington to go all the 
way, and they were eliminated in the first round by eighth seeded Montreal.&nbsp; 
However, three of us did have Chicago to take it all, and they took the Stanley 
Cup in six games from the Philadelphia Flyers.&nbsp; Michael Arvold, who was not 
one of the three picking Chicago, managed to come away with the Gold based on 
his strong support for Philly throughout the playoffs.&nbsp; He correctly picked 
San Jose to face Chicago in the West Finals, and was the only player to give 
Philly a 3 out of 4 in the East.&nbsp; This let him edge out Mike Carroll, who 
took the Silver, and correctly had Chicago on top in the end.&nbsp; Ann Laffaye 
edged out hubby Pat, breaking the tie for third by having Chicago with the full 
16 points in the Final.&nbsp; For Michael Arvold, this is his second Gold 
Trophy, following up on his win in the MLB World Series in 2007.&nbsp; Mike 
Carroll is making his grand entrance into the Hall, to be honored as its 57th

With all of our players picking the same 5 out of 6 conference champions 
(Boston, Cleveland, Orlando, LA Lakers and San Antonio), this was destined to be 
a close race.&nbsp; All of those picks won except San Antonio (Dallas beat 
them), so the final conference was key.&nbsp; We had players picking Denver, 
Portland and Utah.&nbsp; It came down to the last day of the season, and a Utah 
loss gave the conference to Denver.&nbsp; Throughout the season cousins Larry J. 
Waldman and Larry F. Waldman fought over the top spot, with Enrique, Len, Steve 
and Pam hanging around.&nbsp; Larry J. (who picked Denver) pulled away toward 
the end, and in the frantic fight for the remaining trophies, Steve Mayhew, 
Enrique Rivera and Pam Wood wound up tied for second.&nbsp; Since they each had 
four correct champions they wound up sharing the second and third place 
trophies.&nbsp; For Larry J., in his rookie season, this is his second straight 
Gold, following up on his win in NCAA March Madness.&nbsp; Very, very 
impressive!&nbsp; For Steve, Enrique and Pam, they are earning their 6th, 3rd, 
and record 13th trophy (or should we say 2/3 of a trophy) respectively.&nbsp; 
It&#39;s nice to see the rookies and the veterans sharing the glory.</font></span></p>

This was a wild version of March Madness.&nbsp; Of our 37 contestants, seven 
different champions were predicted, with three of the number one seeds (Kansas, 
Kentucky and Syracuse) getting most of the picks.&nbsp; Of course it was the 
fourth number one seed, Duke, who no one picked to win, that was the only one to 
even make it to the Final Four!&nbsp; It was a fifth seed, Butler, that 
surprised everyone and took on Duke for the championship, losing only when a 
desperation shot at the buzzer clanked off the backboard and rim.&nbsp; So we 
had a disastrous pool, with the winner scoring just 86 points out of a possible 
192.&nbsp; In contrast, prior year winners scored 154, 146, and 162.&nbsp; At 
any rate, a Waldarry rookie, Larry J. Waldman, was able to rise to the top and 
bring home the Gold for his maiden entry into the Hall of Champions.&nbsp; The 
perfect way to make a grand entrance.&nbsp; Pam Wood, our perennial competitor, 
took the Silver - she also took the Silver last year, and the Bronze in 2008 - a 
great mark of consistency.&nbsp; Jack Thomas hung in to land the Bronze taking a 
final score tie-breaker from Michael Arvold.&nbsp; This follows up on Jack&#39;s 
Silver in the College Football Bowl Pool several months ago.&nbsp; 
Congratulations to all, especially to Larry J. on his grand entrance to the 
Hall!</font></span></p>

<p>
<em class="style14"><strong class="style15">This was another great season for 
our flagship NFL regular season pool.&nbsp; It started to take shape as early as 
week two, when Dan Cissell won the week and earned his very first entry into the 
Waldarry Hall of Champions.&nbsp; Amazingly, he followed that up with a win the 
following week, for our first ever back to back wins.&nbsp; This propelled him 
into first place in our overall season standings, a place he never relinquished 
for the remainder of the season.&nbsp; By week 5, Wendy Varga and Bobbie Arvold 
took over the 2nd and 3rd slots.&nbsp; They gave up these positions periodically 
during the season, allowing entry from Pat Laffaye, Craig Thomas, and Steve 
Mayhew, but by week 11 Wendy and Bobbie kept them behind.&nbsp; Wendy made a 
strong run at Dan, closing a 21 point gap down to just 3 points, but she simply 
ran out of time.&nbsp; Of note, Dan was the only multiple week winner during the 
season.&nbsp; So special congratulations to Dan Cissell on making a grand 
entrance into the Hall with a giant Gold and two weekly wins, to Wendy Varga on 
her Silver Medal and her first entry since taking week 2 in the 2006-2007 
season, and to Bobbie Arvold taking her first Bronze, adding to her week 15 in 
last year&#39;s pool.</strong></em></p>

the Waldarry Hall of Champions), and Pam Wood (who won the NFL Regular Season 
Pick &#39;Em Pool the last two years).&nbsp; They each won the next three weeks, 
bringing it all down to the last game of the season.&nbsp; Ali and Brent went 
with Denver, who was upset by Kansas City.&nbsp; Pam went with the Jets, who 
trounced Cincy for a game they needed to make the playoffs.&nbsp; That gave Pam 
yet another Gold, and Ali and Brent share the Silver and Bronze.&nbsp; So 
congratulations to Pam on expanding her first place lead on the all-time 
leaderboard, to Ali on adding another trophy (actually two half trophies) giving him a total of 
four and a half, and especially to Brent on his very first entry into the Hall of 
Champions!</p>

<p class="style7"><u>Summary</u>: We were a pretty biased group for this pool - 
12 of 13 picked the Dodgers over the Phillies, and 10 picked the Yankees over 
the Angels.&nbsp; Of course the Phillies downed the Dodgers, but the Yankees did 
manage to take out the Angels.&nbsp; Billy had the Phillies to take it all, so 
he had a good shot at the Gold.&nbsp; But the Yankees wiped them out in 6 games, 
pitting all those Yankee fans against each other.&nbsp; Len and Joe both 
correctly has the Yankees in 6, which propelled them to the top two spots.&nbsp; 
Len also correctly had the Yanks in 6 over the Angels, which earned him the 
Gold.&nbsp; Ryan&#39;s Yanks in 7 in the World Series, with a correct Yanks in 6 
over the Angels brought him to the Bronze.&nbsp; Len has been red hot of late, 
making this his second Gold of 2009 (also the NBA playoffs), and he also managed 
the Silver in last year&#39;s MLB WS Pool - a great mark of consistency.&nbsp; It is 
also his 8th entry into the Waldarry Hall of Champions.&nbsp; Joe gets this 
Silver to follow up his Bronze in the MLB Regular Season pool, another great 
mark of consistency.&nbsp; For Joe, it is his also his 8th entry into the Hall.&nbsp; 
For Ryan, a 2009 rookie in our pools, he is following up on a recent weekly win 
in the NFL Pick &#39;Em pool with this Bronze - not a bad start at all!</p>

<div>
	<span class="style13">Summary</span>: This was an exciting pool that came 
	down to the final game of the season for us.&nbsp; Bob had the early lead 
	during the season, but as the Braves stumbled it led to a four way race 
	between Bob, Pam, Joe and Ed.&nbsp; They all bounced around the top four 
	positions for a while, with Bob and Pam fighting it out for the top spot in 
	the last week.&nbsp; Len came up above Ed in the last couple of weeks, to 
	fight Joe for the third spot.&nbsp; On the last day of the season, based 
	upon number of wins for several teams, Bob squeaked by Pam for the top spot.&nbsp; 
	Len and Joe had to go into the playoff tie-breaker between the Tigers and 
	the Twins, and the Twins&#39; 12th inning win gave the Bronze to Joe.&nbsp; They 
	actually tied at 122 points, but Joe had the tie-breaker, with four champs 
	to Len&#39;s two.&nbsp; Of great notice, Pam had a full five out of the six 
	division winners picked correctly - the Yankees, Twins, Angels, Phillies and 
	Dodgers.&nbsp; Her only miss was picking the Cubs instead of the Cardinals.&nbsp; 
	Pam lost the top spot to Bob, who had four of the six champs (he missed the 
	Phillies), by having only 16 teams within 10 wins (the lowest number in our 
	pool) to Bob&#39;s 24 (the highest number in our pool).&nbsp; All in all a great 
	exciting season.<br />

Of our ten players, five had Kobe and the Lakers and five had LeBron and the 
Cavaliers taking it all.&nbsp; The Cavs caved to the Orlando Magic in the 
Eastern Finals, and Kobe drove his Lakers all the way past the Magic for the 
Trophy.&nbsp; Denver made it to the Western finals, and that cost a couple of 
our Lakers players several points, as they only gave Denver the lowest score (1 
point) for reaching that level.&nbsp; Len Bergstrom was nearly perfect at 62 
points, riding to the Gold on Kobe&#39;s back.&nbsp; Larry Waldman&#39;s 61 points drove 
to the Silver, and Joe Milano edged out Steve Mayhew and Bob Waldman for the 
Bronze.&nbsp; Each had 59 points, but Joe took it on the tie-breakers.&nbsp; 
Len, a frequent medal winner, makes this his second Gold Title, having taken the 
top spot in the NCAA March Madness Pool in &#39;07.&nbsp; For Larry this is his 
third Silver (adding to NFL Playoffs &#39;09 and MLB WS &#39;06), as he continues to 
chase that elusive Gold.&nbsp; For Joe, he has made this pool his specialty.&nbsp; 
He took the Gold in the NBA Playoffs in &#39;07, and also pulled off the Bronze last 
year.&nbsp; Three straight years earning a trophy in the same pool is a Waldarry 
record!&nbsp; Great job, guys.</font></span></p>

In our very first Stanley Cup playoff pool we showed an amazing lack of skill.&nbsp; 
Our eleven players chose five different potential champions (five had Detroit), 
but not one had the ultimate champion, the Pittsburgh Penguins.&nbsp; Pittsburgh 
downed Detroit, 2-1, in the seventh game of the finals.&nbsp; Joyce Fubini, who 
was in last place at the conclusion of the first round, recovered smartly, and 
was able to leverage her 13 points given to Pittsburgh in the final round into 
her very first Gold Medal, after pulling off the Silver in the NBA regular 
season pool two years ago.&nbsp; Ryan Milligan, also with 53 total points (but 
only 12 in the final round for Pittsburgh), grabbed the Silver, a nice follow-up 
to his Gold in the NCAA March Madness basketball pool this year.&nbsp; Finally, 
Devon Shuman grabbed the Bronze.&nbsp; He also had 
Pittsburgh with 13 points in the final round, but earlier shortfalls gave him an 
overall total of 52 points.&nbsp; The 13 did allow him to nudge out Joe Milano 
(also 52 points) who had Pittsburgh with 12 in the finals.&nbsp; This is Devon&#39;s 
first pool entry, and one of the few rookies to pull down a trophy on his first 
attempt.&nbsp; 
Congratulations to all trophy winners!</font></span>&nbsp;</p>

<span style="font-weight: 400">During the season six of our ten players spent at 
least a week in the top spot.&nbsp; But as the season came down to its last 
month, Enrique Rivera and Bob Waldman began a back and forth battle at the top, 
with Steve, Joe and Tom in a fight for third place.&nbsp; It came down to the 
last day of the season, with Enrique holding on for the Gold, and Bob having to 
settle for the Silver.&nbsp; Portland tied Denver for the Western Conference 
crown, but Denver took it on a second level NBA tie-breaker.&nbsp; That was the 
difference that gave the title to Enrique.&nbsp; In a stunning last day as well, 
Steve Mayhew jumped all the way from fifth to third, as San Antonio passed 
Houston and Dallas passed New Orleans.&nbsp; It was about as exciting as it 
could get, with so much based on the very last day of the season.&nbsp; For 
Enrique, who finished third in this pool two years ago, it is his second entry 
into Hall, and his first time bringing home the Gold!&nbsp; Bob and Steve have 
had multiple entries into the Hall - now at eight for Bob, and five for Steve.&nbsp; 
Congratulations to all three on their return to the Hall of Champions!</p>

award in the Baseball World Series Pool in 2006).&nbsp; Craig Thomas took the

This was the first Waldarry College Bowl Football Pool, based on 34 college bowl

Oklahoma, 24-14.&nbsp; Brent Koplitz&#39; pick of Florida gave him the Gold over 
David Leib, who went with Oklahoma.&nbsp; George Rosevally also used Florida to 
hang onto the Bronze by 7 points over his nearest challenger.&nbsp; Brent, who 
is proudly entering the Waldarry Hall of Champions for the first time, picked 24 
of the 34 winners correctly, tying two others for that honor.&nbsp; David and 
George are both making their second appearance in the Hall, David having won 
week 10 in the NFL Regular Season Pool this year, and George who took second

<strong style="font-weight: 400"><font color="#000000"><u>Summary</u>: Three 
long-time Waldarry Poolsters took the top three spots this season.&nbsp; In an 
amazing display of football prognostication, Pam Wood made it two years in a row 
as the champ of the Waldarry Pick &#39;Em Pool.&nbsp; Not an easy feat by any means.&nbsp; 
Pam, Joe Milano and Len Bergstrom were joined by David Leib in a fierce fight 
for the top spot throughout the season, and they all hung on to remain in the 
top four spots.&nbsp; Pam took the lead after week 15&#39;s results and held on for 
the Gold trophy.&nbsp; Joe has claimed the Silver, and Len the Bronze.&nbsp; 
Craig Thomas was the only multi-week winner during the season, walking away with 
weeks 6, 14 and 17, repeating the hat trick of Bill Brewster last season.&nbsp;

This was the very first Waldarry NFL Regular Season Survival Pool, in which each 
player tries to pick a single team that will win a game each week, and continues 
along until their pick loses.&nbsp; You are limited in that you can only pick a 
given team one time during the season.&nbsp; Of the 24 participants, six were 
eliminated in week one, six more in week two, two in week three, five in week 
four, and one in week six.&nbsp; So only four of our 24 players made it past 
week 7.&nbsp; Week 11 saw the elimination of Michael Arvold and Ali Jian, giving 
them a tie for the Bronze trophy.&nbsp; Bob Waldman and son Billy Waldman then 
slugged it out until Billy fell in week 16.&nbsp; That gave Bob the Gold, and he 
was able to continue through all 17 weeks picking winners and giving him a 
perfect undefeated season.&nbsp; Over the entire Yahoo population only 1.04% 
made it through the season unscathed, so we can all be very proud of Bob&#39;s 
performance!&nbsp; Congrats to all trophy winners!</p>

<p class="style7"><u>Summary</u>: We had sixteen players, with 8 picking Boston 
to win it all, 6 picking the Dodgers, 2 picking Tampa Bay, and zero picking 
Philadelphia.&nbsp; So, of course, Philly won it all, giving all our players 
relatively low scores.&nbsp; Tom McClure and Len Bergstrom were the only two 
players to even pick the World Series participants (Tampa Bay vs. Philadelphia) 
correctly, and that led to their 1-2 finish in our standings.&nbsp; For Tom, 
this was his maiden entry into the Waldarry Hall of Champions, a nice way to 
come in with a Gold Medal.&nbsp; This is Len&#39;s first entry since he also took 
the Silver in the NBA Playoffs in 2007.&nbsp; In a hot contest for third place, 
Steve Mayhew squeaked it out by one point over George and Joe, letting Steve 
follow up his Gold in the MLB regular season with a Bronze in the World Series 
pool - most impressive!</p>

	<span class="style13">Summary</span>: It was a good run this year.&nbsp; Early on 
	Larry Waldman had the top spot, but that faded quickly and he ultimately 
	dropped to the bottom.&nbsp; Jessie Novak-Cramer took over the top spot, and she, Steve 
	Mayhew, and Billy Waldman moved around a lot in the top positions.&nbsp; About 
	80% of the way through the season Steve took over and never let go.&nbsp; Jessie 
	bounced around a bit, Billy and Jesse&#39;s dad, Ed, fought over the remaining 
	top positions, and in the end Jessie took a solid second spot, with Billy 
	edging out Ed for third based on&nbsp;the tie-breaker rules (three division 
	champs versus two division champs).&nbsp;
	Jessie and Billy were the only players to have three division champions 
	picked correctly - both had the Angels, Phillies and Cubs.&nbsp; Steve only had 
	the Angels and the Cubs, but his overall standings were far more accurate, 
	earning 92 points whereas Jessie and Billy only had 88 and 86 respectively.&nbsp; 
	Steve also had a pool-leading 22 of the 30 teams for which he predicted 
	their number of wins within 10 of their final number.<br />

Joe fought it out for the 2, 3 and 4 slots.&nbsp; Billy stayed on to 
claim the Gold, Joyce Fubini grabbed the Silver, and Pam Wood nudged out Joe 
Milano on the last day of the season to take the Bronze.&nbsp; It is interesting 
to note that Steve Mayhew was the only player that picked three correct 
champions (Boston, Detroit and Utah), but his overall standings picks were 
mid-range, and his picking of the number of games won by each team was the 
lowest in the pool (9 right out of 30).&nbsp; Both Billy and Joyce had Detroit 
and Utah as correct champions, and Pam had Boston and Detroit.&nbsp; Chris was 
the only one who correctly chose Orlando to win their division, and nobody had 
the LA Lakers or the New Orleans Saints to come out on top.&nbsp; As a matter of 
fact, everybody had New Orleans coming in fourth!&nbsp; Billy had the best 
overall standings with 96 out of a possible 120 points, and Joe had the best 
prediction for team wins, with 15 of the 30 teams being correctly within 5.&nbsp; 
A special congratulations to Joyce Fubini on her first entry into the Waldarry 
Hall of Champions, to Billy Waldman on his second Gold Medal (he took the NFL 
2006-2007 regular season top spot), and to Pam Wood for taking back-to-back Bronze

points in the final round, giving him 40 of the possible 48 points, and the Gold

his weekly wins, one this season and one last season.&nbsp; George Rosevally had 
the upstart Giants with a relatively strong 6 in the final round and was able to

George&#39;s first entry into the Waldarry Hall of Champions!&nbsp; In a dogfight 
for third place, with three players (Bob, Len and Evans) tied for third at 37, 
Bob came away with the prize based upon his 6 points for the Giants in the

correctly (Philly, the Cubs and Arizona took the titles).&nbsp; As to predicting 
the number of wins per team, Barry came within ten wins for&nbsp;an astounding 27 of 
the 30 teams!&nbsp;For overall placement of teams throughout the standings, Barry led 
with 96 points, Billy second with 94, and then it dropped to Len and Bob with 
88.&nbsp; Billy and Bob were the only players to have a division forecast 
perfectly - Boston, New York, Toronto, Baltimore, and Tampa Bay in the AL East.&nbsp; 
The worst individual placement pick was Bob picking Arizona to finish last in 
the NL West and they won the division championship.&nbsp; That was the only zero 
awarded for team placement.&nbsp; Congratulations to Barry on his first entry 
into the Waldarry Hall of Champions (with a Gold no less!), and welcome back to 
Billy &amp; Bob.</p>

<strong style="font-weight: 400"><font color="#000000"><u>Summary</u>: We had 8 
of the 14 entrants picking best season record Dallas to go all the way, and they 
were eliminated in the first round by 8th seeded Golden State.&nbsp; Chicago 
knocked off Miami (who had one player pick them as champs), also in the first 
round.&nbsp; Two people picked Phoenix, who went down to San Antonio in the 
second round, and the three who picked San Antonio to go all the way got it 
right this time.&nbsp; When Cleveland upset Detroit in the semi-finals it shook 
up our standings a bit, and then San Antonio aced Cleveland in four straight 
games to take the finals.&nbsp; Joe Milano rode San Antonio through to take 57 
of the 64 points and the Gold medal.&nbsp; It is his first top three trophy in 
the Waldarry Hall of Champions, although he did take home one weekly winning in 
the NFL Regular Season pool.&nbsp; Len Bergstrom continued to show his 
basketball prowess, following up his NCAA March Madness Gold with a Silver in 
this pool.&nbsp; Len had San Antonio with only 15 out of 16 in the finals, but 
his earlier picks gave him the edge against Michael and Larry who had San 
Antonio going all the way, but some mess-ups earlier.&nbsp; And finally, 
congrats to Michael Arvold, who makes his grand entry into the Waldarry Hall of 
Champions with the Bronze medal, as his San Antonio pick landed him a total of 
56 points and third place overall. Great going, Joe, Len &amp; Michael.</font></strong></em></span></p>

Division, and only two players had Utah winning the Northwest.&nbsp; Five 
players (Len, Enrique, George, Billy &amp; Larry) had four of the six division 
champions chosen correctly.&nbsp; Len was the only player to have two division 
final standings chosen perfectly from top to bottom, and Penny had forecast the 
number of wins within 5 for 18 of the 30 teams, which was one better than 
Enrique for the high in this category.&nbsp; The final results were very close, 
with Penny&#39;s balance of standings, champions and wins giving her the very slight 
edge over Len and Enrique.</font></strong></em></span></p>

a wide open field for everyone.&nbsp; Only 3 players had Indianapolis to take it 
all, which they did, downing Chicago in the Superbowl.&nbsp; Bob&#39;s winning entry 
was perfect except for two first round losses costing him one point each.&nbsp; 
Pam also had Indy (and a perfect first round as well), but lost 3 points when 
New Orleans won in the second round and she only gave them 1 of 4 possible 
points.&nbsp; Steve, who edged out Larry for third, only gave Indy 11 out of the 
possible 12, but still beat Larry (who was the third player giving Indy the full 
12) due to some earlier round mishaps in Larry&#39;s choices.&nbsp; Congrats to all

<p><u>Summary</u>: It was a very unusual season, as Billy won week one and 
managed to continue to hold the top spot for the entire season!&nbsp; The fight 
for second and third was wicked, and it was just a matter of who held those 
spots when time ran out.&nbsp; It was a really good battle all the way.&nbsp; In 
another surprise, there were five repeat winners for the weekly results - Billy, 
Samir, Steve, Ann and Bill R. each won two weeks.&nbsp; Some very surprising 
results compared to prior years.</p>

Bob&#39;s New York over Detroit in 6 games prediction landed him 25 points out of
